 SMART PASSAGE FROM LONDON. The Susanna, a German ship of 1873 tons, arrived at Sydney last week after a remarkably smart passage of 70 days from London. This does not establish a record, but many years have elapsed since a sailing vessel has succeeded in accomplishing the voyage in anything like such good time. Captain Schutt, who is in command, states that the Equator was crossed on the 22nd day out, and that the Cape of Good Hope was rounded when 44 days out from London. The casting was run down with strong south westerly winds, which enabled the ship to make such an excellent run. The dis tance from long. 11. east to long. SO. east was covered in 13 days, and Â±0 days later Tasmania was rounded. Nine days were occupied in running from Tas mania to Sydney, light winds being ex perienced the whole time.
