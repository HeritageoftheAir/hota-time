 ? : TO SYDNEY IN THREE DAYS! , ; The question of increasing speed in air travel appears ^: to take pride of place on agenda papers at all meetings con vened to discuss plans to inaugurate new, or improve exist- ; ing air services. Yesterday's cables suggest that, as an outcome of the British Air Ministry's plans for an attempt on the distance record, and other plans, Sydney may soon be within three days of England. The coming of the day when Australia finds itself such a short 'com- mercial' time from England .will probably go down in history as important as did the first .flight from England. It will be a delight to see aviation experts achieve such an ambition, for we have heard and read so much about it that it is something that certainly will come. But should we be optimistic and expect the 'air-linking' of England and the Commonwealth to be achieved in as quick a time as a bullet takes to reach its target? The word 'soon' and the phrase 'in the near future' are very misleading. There is no doubt, as was previously stated, that Australia will get within three commercial flying days of England (the remarkable progress made by the aero plane indicates that) but why rush plans and create in the minds of the public the idea that future events will take place like a flash. Aviation has already had too many set-backs due, to some extent, to public disappointment at the failure of some bright plan or other which was to have done wonders. As pointed out here but a few days ago, the service which was to commence on January 1, will not commence before September next, if then. These excursions into the flights of fancy, this propaganda is ridiculous. No one is foolish enough to put any confidence in what are but pious aspirations. AUSTRALIA— SINGAPORE— ENGLAND.
