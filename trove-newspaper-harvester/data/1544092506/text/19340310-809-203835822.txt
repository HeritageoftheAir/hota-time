 TO TIIE EDITOR OF THE AGE. Sir,— in "The Age" of 3rd March Mr. David Little, in referring to the claims of the admirers of the cutty Sark that she was a faster ship than the Ther mopylae, deals with her voyages from China ports to London. A nntirmhip feature about the Cutty Sark was, as will be seen by the following fist of her Australian voyages,' that -she lost none of her speed . through becoming water- soaked, as did the softwood American clippers. In the "eighties," after her sail area had been reduced from what it was in her tea-racing days, she bad a race to Sydney against two non wool clippers — Samuel Plimsol and Sir Wal ter Raleigh. The Plimsol and Cutty Sark arrived in Sydney the same day, 79 days out, and the Sir Waiter Ra leigh the following day, Here are her passages:— Left London 25th Nov., 1S72; arrived Mel bourne. 11th Feb.. 1873—78 dayo.

Mr. Peowrie, in his latter published on Saturday last, asks if the Cutty Sark could be brought to Victoria . to lake part in the Centenary celebrations. The reply is that it would cost loo much to make this veteran of the seas sea worthy for the long voyage. A belter ship for show purposes would oe the old Sobraon. now In Sydney Harbor, which was a regular passenger ship to Mel bourne from London in the duys of the clippers, of which she was one of the best. — Yours, &c„ Pascoe Vale.
