 ARRIVAL OF THE WOOLLAHRA. Again, in the wool clippers' race horne, the Sydney owned composite barque Woollahra has upheld her fair reputation of a fast salier. A cable elsewhere, announcing her arrival &nbsp; at London from Sydney, makes her passage to have been 87 days. At all events there are the Achilles, which left eight davs before her ; the Orontes, four days before her ; and the Glamis, which loft Newcastle 12 days ahead of her, she ap- pears to have beaten. The little Cutty Sark left here two days after her. Her arrival will now be looked for with some interest. ' _
