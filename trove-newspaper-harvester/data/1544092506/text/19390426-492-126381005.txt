 IN THREE DAYS London-Sydney Flight LATEST ' PLANES MELBOURNE, Wednesday. it was announced by Sir Donald Banks, Permanent Undor-Secre - tary for Air, in Great Britain and one of the three members of the British Air Mission to Australia, that aeroplanes able to cover the distance 'between London and Syd ney in three days were npw being built in England. They were landplanes capable of a speed of 250 miles an hour, with a range of 2U00 miles. On such a service, he continued, the planes would have to fly day and night and make only six calls during the trip, for refuelling. They would be big enough to accommodate 12 passengers day and night and mail. It was not intended that this ser vice should supersede tho existing fly ing-boat service, which was both com fortable and popular. The now ser vice would be used and recognised entirely as a special express for pas sengers and mail. Because of lack of planes it would not be possible, when the service was inaugurated, to main tain a regular service to a strict schedule. The type of plane to be used would have its first tests over the Atlantic from Croydon (England) to America In about a year's time. It was sug gested that the planes will be ready for the Australian service in 1942. Sir Donald Banks, who was accom panied by Lady Banks, left for Eng land in the Orford yesterday. He said that Australia had made moro than satisfactory progress in all chan nels of civil aviation.
