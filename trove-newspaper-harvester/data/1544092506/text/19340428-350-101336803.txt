 The Air Mail Not So Fast HIHAT tlio London-Sydney air mail idoos not gain much ■ in time on the ordinary sea route mail iB tho burdon of a complaint expressed by "Truth" in which the experience of Mr T. L. Musgrove, of Evans Street, Ponrith, is • quoted. Mr Mucgrove wrote to (jhat • paper statins that he had Jw'-iiivijd two letters front London oh S£rif,0! •" One had come by air mail posted' in London on 9th March, and .the other by ordinary^ mail posted London on March 5. It liadi taken; a month for tho air mail to reach ',its destination in Syd ney. It was Jonly four days fatter than the ordinary mail! Mr McVey, superintendent of mails at the G.P.O., when interviewed by the paper, admitted that the airmail had not proved as great a time-saver as was first hoped. The post for air mail letters to Australia .closes each Saturday in London, and naturally letters posted prior to Saturday re main in London awaiting transporta tion.' In the case of Mr Musgrove's n.ir mail letter, it had been postod on the Wednesday, which mount that it hnd a delay of three, days beforo the closing day of tho 'post. The sched ule of the air mail service is:—Lon don to Karachi, 7 days; Karachi to Colombo, 5 days; three days' wait in Colombo, 3 dayi?; Colombo to Perth, 10 days, Porth tp Sydney, 3 dayB. This is normally a total of 28 days, but Mr Musgrove's letter watled three days in London, thus explaining the 31 days travel." i ' It Pays to Advertise—In ,the ,f Times"
