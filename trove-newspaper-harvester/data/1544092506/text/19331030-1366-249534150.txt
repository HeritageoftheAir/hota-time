 LONDON TO SYDNEY In Three Days "With aeroplane engines in their present state of development it is possible for the .flight from London to Sydney to be made within three days allowing for night flying and relief pilots," said Flight-Lieutenant S. J. Moir, moir, president pre;sia«ut «i1 of the «« New o»u«. South Wales Aero Club, when recently discussing the record that might be established in air races between" LoTdon and Australia in the near future. The aerial distance between London and Sydney is about 12,000 miles, according to flight reckoning," added Flight-Lieutenant Moir. "There are already several reliable makes of aeroplanes which are consistently cruising at 250 miles an hour and are capable up to 280- or 290 miles an hour under favourable wind conditions. A pilot flying solo could make Sydney from London in one of these machines flying only ten hours per day, giving fourteen hours out of each 24 for attention to the engine and rest and sleep. Assuming the weather conditions were not favourable, and that head, instead of following, winds -were encountered, then flying 12 hours daily at- • 250 miles an hour would give a daily journey of 3000 miles, thus bringing Sydney within four days of L(Jndon. "But assuming the same machine v.-as flown with relief pilots, with ample provision for fuelling on the j ourneyi jt would be possible for 22 hours daily to be flovn. which would ei Ve a daily distance of'from 5500 to 6000 miles', according to the weather and wind conditions. With favourable conditions and ordinary pilot's "luck," the journey to Sydney could accomplished -within from 48 to 50 hours from London." Referring to the time likely to be taken by the winner of the centenary air race from England to Australia, the Chief of the. Air Staff, Air-Commodore S. J. Goble, said: "I think two and a half days to three days will win the race." Sir Charles Kingsford Smith said that he thought the route could be covered in three and a half days.
