 NIGHT FLYING THREE DAYS TO LONDON. LONDON, Sunday. Quoting the prophecy of the Dutch Airways representative, Mr. Plesman, that a three-day London-Sydney service would be operative in 1941, the "News- Chronicle" announces that Imperial Airways have a similar objective, and for this reason the airports en route will be equipped in order to permit regular night flying.
