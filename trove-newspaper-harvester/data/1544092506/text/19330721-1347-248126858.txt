 FAST LETTER TRANSPORT TO LONDON A LETTER posted in Sydney can now reach London in 22 days ! This Is proved by a letter written by Dalgety and Co., London, dated June 15, to their Brisbane office. It says: "We have been interested to receive your letter of May 25, which we note was despatched on the steamer Nieuw Zeeland, to connect with the Dutch air mail from Batavia, leaving there on June 7. This is 21 days from Brisbane, or approximately two weeks ahead of the usual mall route." For some time many Sydney, Mel bourne, and Brisbane firms have been posting letter mail aboard the K.P.M. liners Nieuw Zeeland and Nieuw Hol land, one of which leaves Australia once a month. The mail is taken to Batavia, where' the Dutch air line carries it to Lon don, on a regular eight-day schedule. The fastest time by the regular British ah" mail — by steamer to India, and from there to England by air — is 27 days. The Sydney office of the K.P.M. will accept mail.
