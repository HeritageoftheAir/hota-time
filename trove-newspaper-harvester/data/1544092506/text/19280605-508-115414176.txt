 A fact a Day About Sydney AN ABO. DANDY Remarkable Native Who Cut a Figure in London BENNELONG Point, according to Mit- chell Library and other authorlties, was named after an aboriginial who, like Chico, appeared to have been a very re markable fellow. When Governor Phillip returned to England he took home with him two abo- riginals who had won his admiration. One was known as Bennilong — in this case it is spelt with the "i" by one writer — and the other as Yemmerrawannyca. The English climate did not sult the lat ter, who died. The other young fellow, Bennilong, not only thrived, but appears to have taken London by storm. Adopting English dress, and quickly attuning himself to his new social sur roundings, he was quite a circumstance at banquets and other functions in London. It was an unfortunate day for Benni long when he returned to Australia. The call of the bush again gripped him. He cast aside the clothes, including the evening dress suit, in which, with its lace frills, he had been a sartorial lion in London, and threw in his lot with the blacks once more. He rejoined his tribe, participated in tribal fights, and, sad to relate, later took to drink. He came to an untimely end, and, after, it is said, having sus tained serious wounds in quarrels. A brick hut was erected on the east side of Sydney Cove for him and his wife, Go-roo-bar-roo.
