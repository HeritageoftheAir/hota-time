 THE HOT AIR MAIL NOT SO FAST AFTER ALL 1*HE London-Australia, via Karachi, Air Mail is not proving so swift after all. In fact, the difference in time between the air mail and the ordinary mail is almost neg ligible. Last week, 'Truth' received a com plaint from Mr. T. L. Musgrove, cf Evans-street, Penrith^ stating that he had received two letters from London on April 9. One had cdine by air mail posted in London on March 9, and tli; other by ordinary mail posted in Lon don on March 5. IT HAD TAKEN A MONTH FOR THE AIR MAIL TO REACH ITS DESTINATION IN SYDNEY. IT WAS ONLY FOUR DAYS FASTER THAN THE ORDINARY MAIL! Interviewed by 'Truth,' Mr. McVsy, superintendent of mails at the G.F.O., admitted that the air mail had not proved as great a time-saver as was first hoped. Three Day's Delay The post for air mail letters to Aus tralia closes each Saturday in London, and naturally letters posted prior to Saturday remain in London awaiting transportation. In the case of Mr. Musgrove's air mail letter, It had been posted on thc Wednesday, which meant -that it had a delay of three days before the closing day of the post. Below is the usual . time schedule of the air mail service: â€” London to Karacbl, 7 days; Karachi to Colombo, 5 days; three days' watt in Colombo, 3 days; Colombo to Perth, 10 days; Perth to Sydney. 3 days. Tins is normally a total of 28 days but Mr. Musgrove's letter waited tlirce days in London, thus explaining thc 31 days' travel. So, the air mail does not travel ot itic wings of Pegasus 1
