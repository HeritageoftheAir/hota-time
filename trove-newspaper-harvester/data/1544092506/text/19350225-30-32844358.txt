 EMPIRE AIR MAILS. THE NEW OBJECTIVE. London to Sydney in Seven Days. SYDNEY, Feb. 24. â€” Mr. Francis Ber tram, Deputy Director of Civil Aviation to Great Britain, who, with Mr. L. Guin ness. Mf.. Parliamentary Private Secre tary to the Director of Civil Aviation (Sir Philip Sassoon), reached Sydney from Brisbane on Saturday, said that it was hoped to have a bi-weekly air mail ser vice between Australia and England, flying day and. night, and covering the dis tance between London and Sydney to seven days. The scheme was a very definite one. Technical details, such as ground organisation, aerodromes, and communications had already been worked out, and these would be discussed with .-.he Australian authorities. Mr. Bertram added that the type of plane to be used had not been decided. The matter was being considered by Im perial Airways, who would decide whether it would be desirable to use land planes or flying boats. So far as Australia was concerned, flying boats were more suit able, particularly from a defence point of view,,' and commercially, because no heavy outlay would be required on land ing grounds. Mr. Bertram and Mr. Guinness, who are members of the delegation from the British Post Office, were officially wel comed at the Mascot Aerodrome by the Deputy Director of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Kitto), the Postmaster-General of New Zealand (Mr. A. Hamilton) and representatives of the Civil Aviation De partment.
