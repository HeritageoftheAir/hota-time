 AIR SERVICE 9 London to Sydney FIVE AND A HALF DAYS WINGED TANKERS (Australian Tress Association Cable.) LONDON, May 7. The "Daily Chronicle" says that, following the settlement of the air men's strike, a new company is being organised; for the extension of air lines, which, link by link, will result in All Red mail 'planes, good3 'planes, and serial waggonlits travel ling regularly from London to Aus tralia. Giant aeroplanes are being built, of metal throughout, with all the latest weight-saving devices. Meanwhile, an expert survey of an airway to Syd ney is being made. It will be composed of 11 stations, as follow: â€” Malta, Cairo. Bagdad, Karachi, Calcutta, Rangoon, Singa pore, North Borneo, New Guinea, Dar win, and Sydney. It is estimated that an express ser vice covering 13.000 miles will occupy 1311 hours. Plans include re-fuelling in mid-alr by means of winged tankers, rising from stations. THE BURNEY SCHEME. The Australian Press Association is reliably informed that the Cabinet Committee on Airships approves of a construction scheme, and will probably recommend the Government to bear all llie expenses of establishing a scheme over an experimental period of two years, and that thereafter it is likely to place at the disposal of private, companies the whole of the data relat ing to the results achieved. It is pointed out that the fate of the Bur- ney scheme is still in the balance, and it is not improbable that a majority in the House of Commons, in view of the fact that four committees formerly favored it, will support the adoption of Commander Btirney's proposals.
