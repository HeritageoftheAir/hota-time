 SIR WILFRID LAURIER'S ORIGINAL PROPOSAL. The "All Red" route service is intended to improve the communication between the United Kingdom and Canada, and to ac celerate the carriage of mails and nassen- gers between the two countries. It would provide also a faster service, via Viincou- vcr, between Australia and London. The original proposal of Sir Wilfrid Laurier provided for a four-day service from an English port to Halifax, four days across t-anada and sixteen days to Sydney, or twenty-four days between Sydney and Lon- don.
