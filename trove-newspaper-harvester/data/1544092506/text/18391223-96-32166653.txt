Caps 8225 The attendance of buyers from every qatarter was as tidl as upon any previous occasion, and the *biddings particularly animated, as ni,i be infer red from the prices given ; which, no:winh.,tanding the unsettled state of the money market, must be Sery encouraging to the Colonial Flock Growers, particularly to those whose fleeces, by their in ,roi ement ingrowth and very excellent coudition, evince the careful attention- which has been be .-towed upon them by their owners, to such par ties it must be satisfactory to tind their exertions repoaded to bythepurchasers. It is not intended to be invidious, but it is scarcely possible to pass t'laaoticed the beautiful growth and condition of several of the more celebrated combing flocks, as well as several of the finer fibre clothing wools. hS':aiiar attention to the flocks, which are only in p-rotress of improvement, will no . doubt be ."rowvncd with similar success. The quantity of Austra:i in Wool hitherto receisel has bat.n small ; and, for the most pact, has been in bad con dition. A few choice Cape Wools have produced full pri.es. and shew evident improvelment ; the ready saie which the increased growth of Cape W',ot has met with, may fairly encourage the ;.rowers to proceed with their exertions in the t eelding and management of their flocks.
