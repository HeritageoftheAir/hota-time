 IN FIVE DAYS v Sydney to London AERIAL POSSIBILITIES LONDON, January 28. An article in. the "Outlook," by Com mander Kenworthy, M.P., urges, with out delay, the extension of the Egypt and India air service to Rangoon and Australia. He contends that there are no tech nical difficulties about a weekly both- way service to Australia, and the cost would be less than Â£300,000 yearly on the basis of 5/ a ton per mile. Sydney, he says, could be brought within five days of London by day and night flying, or within ten days by Jay flying. There is not much future for a pas senger service, he pomts out, but the British, Indian, and Australian Gov ernments, by a commercial service, could save much In cabling costs, with the great advantage of a quicker de spatch of commercial documents. The service could not be "All Red." as the existing European and Asian routes must- be used, and thence over the Dutch East Indies to Darwin.
