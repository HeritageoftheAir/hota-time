 |UR MAILS. LONDON TO AUSTRALIA IN m DAYS. ; Mr. Holt Thomas' Contention. (United Service.) j LONDON, Sunday. Mr. Holt Thomas contends that at. a certain altitude the ^ air throughout tbe world shows great similarity. . True the conditions riuping the ground vary, but baaween London and Paris it Is of a fair average standard . The expense of an hours' delay 'between London and Paris is important, but an hour or even a day's d^ay In* the Australian mall would be immaterial as compared with 'the advantages. A breakdown would always bring a fresh machine and a pilot anywhere within 2% days, . with the result tbat the Sydney mall would arrive In 12Vfe days -Instead of 10 days. The idea of reaching India In two days is absurd as the' noise alone would madden the passengers, but hy mall stages it would be easy especially with a mail receptacle instantly transferable at Paris. The distance is ideal for pilot and engine alike. The precision fit the German raids and Brl'dsh retalia tions with the assistance of lighting proved that night flying is practicable. Mr. Thomas demands a small commit tee.
