 OUR SYDNEY LETTER. A GREAT EMPIRE DAY.-TIHAT MUCH DEDATED QUESTION-TRIAL BY JURY.-STRANGE TALK REGARDING AUSTRALIA'S HIGH COURT.-THE 'INDEPENDENCE OF JUDOES.-GIV . ING SPACE TO AUSTRALIA IN LON SDON PAPERS.-A GREAT GRANDSON OF GOVERNOR KIING.. S SYDNEY, Wednesday. Empire Day'bad an added emphasis this time. May 24tdb is the anniversary of tbs birth of Queh Victoria, and this time the Imperial reunion ihad to consider eome thing more-that her son had just boeen laid in his tomb on which the wreaths wore dotyt yet faded.' The mighty linking foroe oef the Crown is reallesod by our demo cratlc interest In it. There Is such . a lackl of the sectional element an to takelit our first Imperial symbol. Emplro Day brings us together, but it ito under the Crown, and when we reflect we realtia that In no other way could we have the name feolltig 'of unity. But Emplro Day boleore yesterday was thought to appeal to the rising generation more thlan to their seniore. It was nocessary to imn press them withl the importance of their great inheritance and so faggs' woro brokbn and .the National Anthem sung, and adults went theolr way wltl a kIild of half thought for the annliversry and ianl Other 'feo their' busineoss or diversions. But the donath of the King gave this par tieular day an added .meaning. Empire Day appealed to the children In' the old way, betit alaso appealed to their oldorii who saw somcitllng in It of vast Import Ino to toile .rcc-a reminder of our slalonessof purpose and destiny, and our agreeooment to agres ill this whether we centest the ppinlt in othelor things or not. At no pirevlolis period, rpeelaklng for fSydnoy, has..the British ,foolig beeon so strong and all pervading, In days gone by youll could always find dissenters- some to tell you.tiat the British flag. was at political half stlaff, and otlhers to rail at the old institutlons; even to speak o1 the old'laid an forolign. You could have gone through this city yesterday searchinog for an antliImporlallst In vain.. You could hIlave looked for him among the privileged; and you could have loolod foe hlim among tle rankle and file; you could have looked for him anywhore: but you woltld not have 0fond himl. Who among our 'ancestore would ever have drelamed that.the Crownl would count for so mucllh? Tho Little Englandeor thoughlt thile Poses slons a soIrcoe of weiakness, bilut they are the strengthil of the old contultlon. Tilhe Crown still rests on its old grey pledestal, but it is supported in those dlays by the Posseselonso, which aecept It as thile firsl and greatest Ihlnk.ln Imperial lnlty. Thus the Possoesion alIt tlOa same time as thley gain strongth from tlhe Crown retullrn it, Great 'Britain with no Emplro might' find it posasible to got oIl with a locally elect ed president; wlth an Empire tulrning 400,000,000 pairs of eyes to the Crown' tle fact must be realised that it is thu greatest Imperial asset we, hIave, This, more or less, was In thei pulblie mind of Sydney yesterday, evidencing itself In' vnrious ways. Whohi Lord Meath estal - lIshed"Emplro Day he worlked better than his most sanguine friends imagined, We accept 'the anlveroary as our great family day; recogniling In each man, woman, and child a relation under the Crown, - ' The Liberal party here published some time ago, a' loneaflt jlstlifyling the trial of the strikelo lenders without a jury. Tilhe eases eltod could hardly hlvo the t5 dorseoment of a ]nwyier, as they deal with nminor offencese, not crimes, "A Judge ean colmmit a man to gaol for contemptl" Wlat .has.contempt to do will cerimo?
