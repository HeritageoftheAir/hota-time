 IN SIX DAYS LONDON-DARWIN AIR MAIL Objective Aimed At AUSTRALIAN STOPS MAY BE REDUCED i SYDNEY, Friday. Mr. A. E. Rudder, director of QANTAS Empire 'Airways Ltd., which has secured the Singapore-Darwm Brisbane air mail contract, said that although there were 24 scheduled stopping places between Singapore and Brisbane, a speedy service was hoped for. j Many of these stopping places were | soon to be eliminated, and, with night flying, it was hoped eventually to cover the journey from London to Darwin in six days. He said that al- ready the passenger traffic available from London to Singapore was tax- ing the accommodation of the Astraea class monoplanes to the utmost. He said that for the Singapore ser- vice to Australia, 10 captains would be employed and 10 assistant pilota and wireless officers. The captains would have to possess a full naviga- tion certificate. Only three passen- gers would be carried on the Singa- pore-Darwin section owing to the amount of petrol needed to cover thi 514 miles between Keopang and'Dar- win across the Timor Sea. The pas- senger space had to be sacrificed to allow maximum amount of air mail to be carried.
