 LONDON TO SYDNEY IN THREE DAYS New Service Will Be Ultra-Efficient LONG-RANGE AIRCRAFT MELBOURNE, April 2D. Sir Donald Banks, the Permanent Under-secretary for Air In Great Brit- ain and one of the three members of the BrltlBh Air Mission to Australia, said today that aeroplanes which would be able to cover the distance between London and Sydney in three days were being built In England. They were land aeroplanes capable of a speed of 2S0 miles an hour for a range of 2,000 miles. On such a service, he continued, the aeroplanes would have to fly day and night, and make only six calls during the trip, for refuelling. They would be big enough to accom- modate 12 passengers, day and night, and mall. It was not intended that the service should supersede the exist- ing flying boat service. The new ser- vice would ho used and recognised en- tirely as a special express for passen- gers and mail. Because ot lack of aeroplanes, It would not be possible, when the service was Inaugurated, to maintain a regular service to a strict schedule. The type of aeroplane used would have its first teBts over the Atlantic from Croydon to America in about a year. It ls suggested that the aeroplanes will bo ready for the Australian service In 1V42. Slr Donald BnnkB, who. ac- companied by Lady Banks, left for Eng- land In the Orford today, said that Aus- tralia bad made more than satisfactory progress In all channels of civil aviation.
