 SYDNEY TO LONDON AND BACK IN 28 DAYS. The Spirit of Australia. WILL START NEXT WELK. SYDNEY, October Ii. I The monoplane Spirit of Australia, in which Captain I! irlry end Flying i'(Ticer Mon will attempt to fly from Sydney to Lindon and back in ¿8 dayfl, was chr'-teued today al tie "{'dimond aerodrome. A luncheon in honour of thc occasion was held later. Speaking at the luncheon, Sir James Murdoch, who assisted in financing thc flight, said lie believed that the best way to improve communications be- tween England and Australia was com- mercial aviation. Ile advised "Pilot Moir to be careful an I cautious in bia fight, as by these mclliodj the cause of aviation would be best eerved. Captain Hurley expressed regret thal he had to go to*Amelina for a machine for the flight, but when he asked a British firm for a machine, with an aerial capacity of 2000 miles, he was laughed at. The best that could be of- fered in Britain was a machine if or £8000, with «ii aerial capacity of »00 miles. He was hopeful that when British manufacturers saw this machine in England they would begin to build aeroplanes and seaplanes to suit Aus- tralian renuiremcuts. The Spirit of Australia cost £3700 and has a range of more (lian 2000 miles. Thc route to be followed by the fliers will, in the main, bc that taken by Sir Alan Cobham and Hinkler, but it is proposed to make fewer night stops Chan either of these aviators. It is estimated that the aerial distance to be covered is 12,000 miles, and it is ex- pected that some days 2000 miles will be covered. Flying Officer Moir said that by do- ing 1200 miles a day it would be pos- sible to make thc journey from Rich- mond tn England inside 10 days. The plane will carry wireless and will be in communication with Australia or England for the whole of thc flight. Trial flights today were entirely satisfactory, and it is hoped lo make a start next week.
