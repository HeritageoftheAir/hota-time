Sydney could be brought within five days of London by day and night flying, or 10 day flights. The British. Indian, and Imperial governments, by a commercial . service, would save much cabling costs, while there would be the great advantage' of the quicker dispatch of commercial documents. The service could not be "all red" Existing European-Asian- routes must be used, thence Via the Dutch East Indies to Darwin.
