 Sydney-London in Nine Days SYDNEY, Thursday. From Sydney to London in nine days will be the endeavour of the Dutch air service, which is to begin not later than July 1. Details had yet to be completed, the general manager in Australia of K.L.M. (Mr. Barker) said to day, but efforts would be made to connect services at Batavia to maintain the nine-day schedule. The present Empire service takes 131/2 days. The Empire fly ing boat service will improve con siderably on that time.
