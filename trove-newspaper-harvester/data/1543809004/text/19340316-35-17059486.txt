 AIR MAIL SERVICE. I LONDON TO SYDNEY. In Eleven Days. (BY OUR SPECIAL COMMISSIONER.) The proposal of Imperial Airways, Limited, to hasten the service between London and Singapore so as to make a regular eight-day timetable practicable either way is of the greatest importance to Australia There is also the possibility that this sec- tion of the journey will be further accelerated within two or three months by nnother day. This will be possible as soon as the negotia- tions, now almost completed, between the British nnd Italian Governments, have settled amicably the route to be flown by the Im- perial Airways' services over Italy At present the Italian Government has political objections to any regular air service, other than national, being flown over the southern section of Italy. This has neces- sitated passengers by air routes to or from India or South Africa travelling from Paris to Brindisi by train. With a direct flight from London to the Italian airport to be decided upon, it will be possible to expedite both the Indian and South African service by another day This will bring Singapore within seven davs of London The distance from London to Singapore by air is officially calculated at 8648 miles This will give an average daily flight of slightly less than 1250 miles Some days It would be moie and some less The air journey from Singapore to Sydney is about 4800 On the same basis that flight should not occupy more than four days This would bring Syd- ney within 11 davs of London According to the provisions of the tender schedule submitted by the Federal Govern- ment to tenderers for tile Brisbane-Singapore section of the journey between Australia and London, the manageis of the service may provide for a six days' lourney between Bris- bane and Singapore This gives an average daily flight of slightly over 700 miles This Is considered absuidly low having regard to the speeds of modern commercial aircraft, many of which can make up to 150 miles per hour when carrying an ordinary pay load It Is urged that there is no Ã­eason why, with the approval of the Federal Government, the conti actors foi the new sei vice should not be able to make the Brisbane-Singapore flight within four days making the starting and landing times such as will permit passengers from Sydney to join the outward aeroplane the day of leaving, and on the day of arrival to leave Brisbane In time for Sydney to be reached befoie dark That would give a two-way 11-day service between Sydney and London, which Is the least the users of that service have a right to expect from the Government and tht. organisers of the service Dissatisfaction li felt in aviation and com mciclal circles at the delay of the Federal Government In making an announcement as to vvhen the Brisbane-Singapore section of the service is likely to commence The tender forms provide for an interval of six months for the successful tenderer to organise the service from the date of the acceptance of the tender If the matter be delayed much longer by the Federal Government there Is a possibility that the service will not be organised until the end of the present year. There were anticipations, encouraged by the Government, that the service would be in operation in June next The responsibility for the Inauguration of the service now rests with the Federal Government
