The equipment and furnish ings would be on a scale of comfort and attractiveness, with cabins of different sizes, some of two and some for four passengers. There would al-^ so be smoking and dining rooms, a look-out platform, and lay-out on the lines of the Australian Transcontin ental railway cars. The safeguards against lire were to be elaborate. It was propose^ to join a separate com pany for the inauguration of the ■service from India to Perth, or if a station was established at Singapore, to run direct to Sydney,
