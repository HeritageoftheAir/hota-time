 IN .FTHREE DAYS LONDON TO SYDNEY MELBOURNE, Tuesday Aeroplanes, which will be able to cover the distance be tween London and Sydney in three days, are now being 'built in England. Sir Donald. Banks, the Permanent Under-Secretary for Air in Great Bri tain, and one of the three members of the British Air Mission to Australia. stated to-day that there were land 'planes capable of a speed of 250 m.p.h. for a range (f 2000 miles. On the Australian service, he con tinued, the 'planes would have to fly day and night, and make only six calls during the trip for refuelling. They would be big enough to accommodate 12 passengers, day and night, and mail. It was not intended that this service would supersede tie existing flying boat service. The new service would be used and recognised entirely as a spe cial express for passengers and mail. Because of lack of 'planes it would not be possible when the service was inaugurated to maintain a regular ser vice to a strict schedule. The type of 'plane to be used would have its lfirst tests over the Atlantic from Croydon, England, to America in about a year. It is suggested that the 'planes will be ready for the Australian service in 1942. Sir Donald Banks, who, accompanied by Lady Banks, left for England in the Orford to-day, said that Australia had made more than sr.isfactory progress in all channels of civil aviation.
