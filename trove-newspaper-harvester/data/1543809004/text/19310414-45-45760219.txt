 LONDON TO SYDNEY Seven and a Half Days London to Calcutta in 3½ days, to Sydney in 7½ days, and to Wellington (N.Z.) in 8½ days sounds magical even with the present accomplishments and progress in aviation. According to British expert opinion, however, day and night air mail ee-Jvices Tinking England with the most distant parts of the Empire in Htt_-e more than a week are well within tbe bounds of possibility. The above schedule of regular, t.u___* ness-like operation, dependent solely on tbe establishment of high-speed ser vices concerned solely with the car riage of mails, was sketched by Sir Bobert McLean (one of the leading men in the British aircrai^ industry; in an interview with Lord Amuirse (British Air Minister) arranged by tbe London Chamber of Commerce. It epitomises the possibilities of im mediate and dramatic acceleration in all existing air services. A 24-__tour schedule throughout the flight and the efficient lighting for night navigation of the routes would oe necessary. Given this organisation, there is no doubt that British aircraft constructors are to-day in a position to build im mediately fast aeroplanes which could maintain such a schedule with ease, cruising with full load of mails on board at .speeds around 150 and 160 miles an hour. Sir Robert pointed out that the aver age speed in summer on the Indian air route between London and Karachi, operated by air liners carrying mails and passengers, was about 28 miles an hour. Malls, he added, should cot be kept stationary for 16 hours of the 24 because they had to travel at tbe same rate as passengers. The services should be separated. Where traffic did not justify separate passenger and mail services over a route, a mail service operating on a 24-hour schedule saould be given preference.
