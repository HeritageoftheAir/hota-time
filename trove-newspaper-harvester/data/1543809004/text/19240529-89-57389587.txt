 POLAR AIR ROUTE London to Tokio, 4| Days. SYDNEY, Wednesday. . Dr. Stcfaneson, the Canadian arctic ex plorer, who was to-day the guest 'of the 'English-speaking Union, reiterated the pre diction that with 10 years of pormal peace development airships would be flying from London to Tokio by the northern route. To illustrate that task was not as diffi cult as it might seem. The speaker pro duced o map of the polar region, men tioning incidentally that no effective maps of the region had been produced in Eng land or America for 7a years, through the a6sump.tion that the. area was not navi gable. What was known as the Polar Sea (or, more accurately, that part of it that was not navigable) was a strip not wider than the Mediterranean, which sepa rated Europe from Africa. Actually, he said, it was only a gulf equivalent to that which separated North from South Ame rica. The extraordinary fact that the breaching of the 'northern route would have on international relations was em phasized .by Dr.'Stefansson, who eaid it opened up a new vista for the closer rela tionship of the peoples of the world. The route of the airships travelling from London to Tokio would be northward over Edinburgh, along the west coast of Nor way and - over the Island of . Nova Zambia, where the route would turn south across Siberia to Japan. The distance was only 4,500 miles, and could be covered Â«i41daEB.' - 'This' will be your tuppence, sir;' said the haughty waitress. 'We're not allowed to take tips here.' The customer frowned. 'I am aware of the fact,' he said, and I thought you would be glad I had broken the rule in your interest.' 'Not with tuppence!' replied the girl. '/Breakm a rule with tuppence is only addm insult to injury.'
