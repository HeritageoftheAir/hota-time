 LONDON TO SYDNEY: 21 DAYS. Ouo of tho priucipal objections to the journey from Eastern Australia to V: London is tho slow pace at which it is accomplished, and tho consequent. waste of vaiuablo timo on tho water— " , , n consideration which deters thou- ' /eands of us from making that ac quaintance with tho Motherland which Is tho ambition of almost every Aus- tralinn. The idoa of utilising the transcontinental railway to subytaiiU- 1 ally rcduco the period is almost within \ (right, but not until the long and weari- soma coastal tour round tho southora ports has glvon way to a quick and comfortablo journey by express can tho traveller look for an amelioration of the prcsont conditions. With mails, however, prospocts aro brighter, aud it is not too rash to predict that within a couplo of years letters from London 'will bo delivered in Dubbo within 22 days of duto of postage— a reduction of almost 30 per cent, on tho timo re quired at prcsont, for contracts haro already been lot for the commencement of important railway constructional work which is to connect Blaeksod, in Ireland, with the already existing Unco of cross-country railway. Conor- ally speaking, tho main idea is to util ise tho Canadian routo in preference to tho Red Sea, aud by tho construc tion of a now typo of steamship of a mall, but finely lined design, to to- 'duco the timo between London aud Winnipeg to fivo days, tho time-table of tho mails would then bo: London to Blacksod, ono dayj Blacksod to Capo St. Ohartaii Labrador, by means of the now steamers, three days; Capo St. Oharles to Winnipeg, by air-lino, 39 hours; and Winnipeg to tho Cana dian wostcrn coast, and theuco across the Pacific to Sydney, 14 days. Tho scheme, as will bo gathered, is no mere proposal it has behind it tho combined resourcoa of practically tho whole of tho Empire, aud, no has boon pointed out, work has already been begun. Tho social and economic benefits which accrue in Australia will bo in calculable.  8YONEV TO LONDON IN U DAYS. Considerable interest has been aroused (states tlie Sydney 'Morning Herald') in shipping circles regarding « proposed new line of trans-Pacific, steamers, by means of which passen gers and mails from- Sydney ' could i-cudi London nearly a week earlier Uian it possible by the present route via Italy. The proposal has emanated from Mr James Hill, tbe American railway magnate, and chairman of the Ijoai-d of directors of the Great North ern liailway system. It is said to be Mr Hill's, intention to order four powerful passenger steamers and plaoe them in the trans-Pacific service to connect with the Hill system of rail ways at Seattle. These steamers ore to be larger and fatter than anything at present running between Sydney and America. Seattle, which is the terminus of the Hill railway systems, is to be the port of call for the Hani line. It is intended that tbe opeed trf the steamers shall be such vs to en- 1 able them to cover the journey 'be-' tween Sydney eua Seattle in IB days. By the aid of the fast railways in America and the speedy Atlantic linen on the other side of the continent, passengers would be landed in London 25 or 26 davv after leaving Sydney, Besides taing of great tonnage tbe vessels, are to be fitted up in the most luxurious style in order to attract the passenger traffic  NEW STEAMSHIP LINE¡ _0_ERIC_VN PROPOSAI;.

London, October Gtli.—It is reported that substantial progress lias been made with a scheme for the establishment of an express mail service between Groat Britain and Australasia, via Canada. Several British shipowning firms are interested, and are treating with a Canadian syndicate for the purchase of 4,000,000 acres on the south-east coast of Labrador, with an ice-free port. It is proposed 'to construct a trans-contin ental railway to the Pacific, and it is claimed that the journey from London to Winnipeg will be performed in five days, and to Sydney in an additional 16*days. Blacksod Bay, in Irolaud, will | be the headquarters of the service on this side of the Atlantic, connecting by; means of a special railway with the 1 main system at Sligo. Tho promoters of tho scheme have arrived at Ottawa, to enlist tho support of tho Canadian Government. It is stated that a bond for a guarantee of £'3,000,000 will be asked for. Mr. Wynne, the Postmaster-General of tho Commonwealth. said, on being seen regarding the message, that the proposal must be very much in tho air at present, as he had heard nothing of ficial about it. Any such shortening of tho mail period between Australia and Great Britain would, of course, be wel comed if it could bo accomplished. In shipping circles in Melbourne nothing definito is known of the proposed scheme, which, if brought to a success-1 ful issue, will shorten the journey from London to Sydney, via Canada, by at least 12 days. Travelling by tho exist ing Canadian-Australasian Royal Mail . line takes from 33 to 3o days to reach Sydney from London. One shipping re presentative pointed out that it would he necessary for the promoters to select a port well south on tho coast of Labra dor. for tho reason that the more north ern ports are ice-bound for months in each year. A very fast class of Bteanier would also liavo to ho utilised to do tho ran across from Blacksod Bay to the Labrador coast, for the journey would have to be accomplished in at least four days to permit of Winnipeg being reached within the stipulated five days. A similar class of boat wonkl he neces sary to do tho remainder of tho trip to Sydney across the Pacific.  LONDON IN 26 DAYS. ■' _ ■■ ■■/■ ■ •Sydney, Friday.

LONDON TO SYDNEY. JOURNEY OF 21 DAYS. PROPOSED NEW SERVICE. ALL RED ROUTE. (United Service Special Cable.) LONDON, Monday Night. It Is reported that substantial pro gress has been made with a soltemo for tho establishment of an express mail servlco between Great Britain and Aus- tralasia, via Canada. Several British siiipownlng firms are Interested, and are- treating - with a Canadian syndicate for tho purchase of 4,000,000 acres on the south-east coast of Labrador, with an lee-free port. It is proposed to construct a trans-con- tlnental railway to the Pacific, and It Is claimed that the journey from Lon don to Winnipeg will be performed in, five days, and to Sydney In an addi tional sixteen days. Blacksod Buy, In Ireland, will be the headquarters of the service on this side of the Atlantic, connecting by means of a special railway with the main sys tem at Sllgo. u lie promoters of tne senemo nave arrived at Ottawa, to enlist the support of the Canadian Government. It Is stated that a bend for a guarantee of £3,000,000 will be asked- for. Mr Wynne, the Postmaster-General of the Commonwealth, said, on. being seen to-day regarding the above mes sage, that the proposal must be very much in the air at present, as lie had heard nothing official about it. Any such shortening, of the mall period be tween Australia and Great Britain would, of course, be welcomed it it could bo accomplished. In shipping circles 'in Melbourne nothing definite is known of the proposed scheme, which; if brought to a successful issue, will shorten the journey from London to Sydney, via Canada, by at least 12 duvs. . Travelling by tho existing Canadian-Australasian Royal Mall line takes from 33 to 35 days to roach Syd ney from London. One shipping re presentative pointed out that it would be necessary for the promoters to select a port-. wall south on the coast of La brador,' for the reason that the more northern ports are ice-bound for months In oacli year. A very fast class of steamer would also have to be utilised to do the run across from Blacksod Bay to the, Labrador coast, for the journey would have to bo accomplished In at least four days to permit of Winni peg boing reached - within- the stipulated five days. A 'similar class of boat would bo necessary to do the remainder of tlio trip to Sydney across the Pacific. ______________  A New Project. LONDON IN.

In 1887 the first transcontinental train of the 'Canadian-Pacific railway entered I Vancouver, aud, aided by tho clamour of I a ncw-botn Imperialism, the subject of the All Red Route " came to tlm front isays the Sydney "Morning Herald" of 21st June). It was the late Mr. William ' Hudclart who went to London in the >. early nineties, full of enthusiasm, to : secure support for a line of fast mail ; steamers he dcuircd to establish .between Sydney and Vancouver. His imperialism j was not questioned, but his uelief in the ; commercial success of the scheme he had | at heart did not convince the city.

For years it j ; struggled, if not precisely with adversity, at least with difl'iculbios. To-day a bril- ' ! liant success, it constitutes a monument ' : to one. oi the most unselfish Australians : j that ever lived, a man who loved his ,- land and his Empire, and in the. practical '. though in a sense pioneering, work of establishing the "All red route," has left . : a monument more enduring than one of brass or granite. It was for long cus- : tomary to ridicule what may be termed ' "I-Iuddart's life work;" to-dav it' is re- ! .cognised that lie laid the foundations and I nurtured in its infancy a something whicii j ; has grown to lie the greatest competitor | to the Suez route, for the i carriage oi mans between the Com- ' inpnwealth and the old country, which 1 now exists. Ncvcrthesless, unless vessels ! of- a greater speed are placed in' com-: j mission, there is little to be feared 1 of Suez losing the bulk of its mail ! i carriage. With speedier ships corr.e in- i ..creased' expenditure, and, after- all, when; financial sacrifices are demanded, Imperial- ' ists are somewhat few and far between. Despite the definite and specific ad- vantages the Suez Canal route enjoys, he who runs may read certain writings , on the wail of time which plainly announce : that even the Dc Lesseps route is i doomed. The -trans-Pgrsian railwav, before 1923, will iink the railway systems otf j Europe and India. By "that date tho" | railway viaduct which is to connect the j ' Ceylon and Indian railways', ' via Adam's ! bridge, will have been constructed, at i least such is a reasonable assumption. I Long before this date the joining of Fremantlc with Sydney will be working, and. here alone a saving in mail transit time of at least four days is anticipated. The trans-Pcrsiau railway will bring : Colombo within nine, or ten days ol: London, so, at least, conservative esti mates place it. It.- will then be possible to travel : between' Frcmantle and Lon- i don, assumiog the speed of the vessels between Fremantlc and Colombo enables the distance to be covered m seven days, in practically two weeks and a-half. If a speed of 20 knots is maintained, there will be a reduction ol 16 days, but on the basis of a 25-knot per hour speed, publicists in London have declared - wilf he demanded when the completing spike of the trans-Persian railway is driven, then the western entrance "to the Com monwealth will be within practically a fortnight of the world's metropolis. A gentleman writing recently from the Royal Colonial Institute, maintained that Madras would be the port of embarkation and disembarkation for the Australian-British mails, to be forwarded by rail across Persia. This is a suggestion Avhich, while interesting, does not commend itself upoii examination. It might be urged that: there are ports nearer to Australia tlian Colombo which could be used ' as the Asiatic land terminal. This is true in a measure, but much money would re- quire to he expended before they could be considered, quite independent of a rail way connection many of them do not enjoy. There is one exception in Wcligama, 26 miles ' east-south-cast of Galle, and roughly 90 ir.ilcs nearer Fre mantlc than' Colombo. Situated on a lino bay, with a two miles wide opening, a breakwater, anil some blasting to remove certain: rocks now forming obstructions, would probably make a perfect harbour. The expense would be considered as un warranted, considering its close proximity to. Colombo,, though it is an axiom that mails he carried-: the longer distahce by rail, where possible, at from 30 to 60 iniles an hour,, than- by sea at a speed .of 20 to 25 statute land miles per hour. As in the case of' the Orient line making Taranto its southern.

While, there- ' fore, tiie existing mail channel) via the j Suez C'a.nal. may he safely taken as not having a prolonged term ot life to run,- there does not aimcay to be any ground j for. not assuming, that, what maybe de signated tlic lind terminal ports for the Australia-Europe mail service in , the! future, must he Colombo and Frcninntle. i A great Imperial statesman, ami cer tainly one of tiie ablest .Governors Ccy- j ion ever had, Sir West Ridgeway, dc- j clarcd, in connection with now com- ; plcteil railway, running from Colombo to tbe north of the island, . that lie hoped ' to live to see the dav when the Austra- ! liar, passenger would enter his railway j carriage"' at Colombo, and leave it at Calais. Events have moved rapidly in! 13 years, and what may, in 1900, have ' appeared to many as the exaggerated - opinion of a (statesman who lias always j endeavoured to look 'into the future, is i now not very far, as. human , time is. measured,, from the verge of realisation— that is, in the main— the through rail way carriage simile , being regarded more ill the - light ot hyperbole. ' The trans continental railway in Australia, the junction, of ' the Ceylon, Indian, -and'Euro- 'Pcan systems is no' lonver a vague and nebulous proposition. The stage of ton actual lias been readied, and the acnern- tion to follow will witness the. coimilc- tlon of a vast scheme, the effects of which arc not easy to estimate. It is as yet early to .speak of Sydney being brought within ,i fortnight, t.'f I.cn- don at the same time, before dismiss- l ing tbe suggestion witli the word " im possible," , it would be well to bear in mind the remark of the late Lord Kel vin respecting the use of. that adjective. OnR tiling is certain— a continuation of the 31-33 dav service, which represents the regular! mail time in this year ot grace, - cannot he cxuccte.d to continue. An alternative monthly service, giving 20 days' transit, is now nrovided, via San Francisco,- but the drawbacks of a ser vice, however excellent in itself, . which presents such' long intervals, missesses.in a commercial sense ilisndvantiiv.es which cannot' be overlooked.

While, therefore, the existing mail channel via the Suex Canal may bo safely taken as not having a prolonged term of life to run, thoro doeB not appear to bo any ground for not as- suming that what may bo designated the land terminal ports for the Australia-Europe mall Bervico in the future muBt be Colombo and Fremantle. A great Imperial statesman, and cer- tainly one of the ablest Governors Cey- lon ever had, Sir WeBt Ridgeway, de- clared, in connection with tho now com- pleted railway , running . from Colombo to the north of the island, that he hoped to live to seo the day when the Australian, pas- senger would enter his railway carriage at Colombo and leave it at Calala, Events have moved rapidly In 13 ycarB, and what may, In 1900, have appeared to many as tho exag- gerated opinion of a statesman who has al- ways endeavoured to look into tho future, is now not very far, as human time is measured, from the verge of realisation-that is, in the main-the through railway carriage simile being regarded moro in the light of hyperbole. The Transcontinental railway In Australia, the junction of the Ceylon, Indian, and Euro- pean systems Is no longer a vaguo and nebu- lous proposition. The stage of tho actual has been reached, and tho generation to follow will witness the completion of a vast scheme, tho effects of which aro not easy to esti- mate. It Is as yet early to apeak of Sydney being brought within a fortnight of London; at the samo time, before dismissing the sugges- tion with the word "impossible," It would bo well to bear in mind the remark of tho lato Lord Kelvin respecting the use of that adjec- tive. One thing is certain-a continuation of tho 31-33 day Bervice, which represents the regular mail time in thlB year of grace, can- not be expected to continue. An alternativo monthly service, giving 29 days' transit, is now provided via San Francisco; but tho drawbacks of a service, .however excellent in itself, which presonts such long inter"als, possesses in a commercial sense disadvan- tages which cannot be overlooked. In addition to the sentimental side or tho benefits, in an Imperial sense, speedy mail communications bring about, there aro those purely business or commercial advantages which aro almost legion To name one, bills in transit, is to indicate not the least important. Tho Panama Canal will not offer a mail service which from the point of \iew of expedition, can ever be seriously compared to that which will be given to Sydney citizens via Fremantle, Cey lon, India, Persia, Russia, and Germany
