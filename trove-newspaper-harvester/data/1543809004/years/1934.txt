 IN THREE DAYS London-Melbourne Flight AUSTRALIANS' PLAN SYDNEY, Friday That an Australian-built monoplane, now in course of construction for en try In the Centenary Air Race, was likely to fly from London to Melbourne in three days was stated to-day at a meeting in the 'Royal Empire Socie ty's rooms. The meeting was called for the pur pose of forming a committee to finance the construction in Sydney of a 'plane to compete in the race. Mr. C. M. C. Shannon, who, pre sided, stated that the machine had been designed by Sydney experts, and the work, which was started about five weeks ago, was being carried out by Sydney craftsmen from materials produced wholly in New South Wales, including the engine. The 'plane had been designed by Mr. L. J. It. Jones, lecturer in aircraft con struction at the East Sydyney Techni cal College; Mr. T. D. J. Leech, 'ec turer In Civil Engineering and Aero nautics at Sydney University: and ex flying olficer D. Saville, R.A.F., formn erly instructor in Navigation at the Seaplane Base, Calshot, England. Mr. Shannon said that 11e had been Informed, as a result of enquiries, that there were no better men in Australia for the job, and If they did not suc ceed no other Australian could. Average 200 Miles an Hour "A machine built abroad' could not be an Australian entry, and as the prize is given by an Australian, it is up to us to show what can be done by an Australian-but machine," said Mr. Jones, who considered the race would be flown at an average rpeed of 200 miles an hour. He said he thought that the dis tance from London to Melbourne could be done in three days. Mr. Leech mentioned that they had already built a machine similar to the one under discussion with satisfactory results. An ergino in else previously had passed all tests and the two en gines to be",placed ia the 'plane would be. of tha same typo. The cost of the plane would be-about £2000. When completed it would be taken to Eng land. About six weeks would be oc cupied on the trip to give plenty of time for studying atmospheric con ditions 'and aerodromes en route.  UNDER EIGHT DAYS ' LONDOK' TO STO'ET IjOBD SEMPH/Ii'S OPINION SYDNEY, FridaJ Lord Benipill. leadme international aviation authority, said to-day that the England Australia air mail could not be regarded as satisfactory until a letter posted in London could be de livered in Svdnev within eieht davs. It was absolutely essential, he said, that mails should' be on the move dur !ng th« whole of the '24 hours dailv. It was a mistake that they should b' held up while passengers ate and slept. Lor a -Sompill said be -thought that the idea of bringing the air mail to .Sydney from Cobtamuiidra by tra'n wap most unsatisfactory. It seemed to hiin. most essential that tin. ma;l should be brought by air all the way. The Mascot aerodrome, he considered,' r wafc greatly in need of improvement, j  19 Bays From Sydney To London A - — RUSHING BY TRAIN, PLANE AND BOAT T eaving Sydney by train on Li Thursday evening, Mr. Frank Packer will be in London in 19 days.

I LONDON TO SYDNEY. In Eleven Days. (BY OUR SPECIAL COMMISSIONER.) The proposal of Imperial Airways, Limited, to hasten the service between London and Singapore so as to make a regular eight-day timetable practicable either way is of the greatest importance to Australia There is also the possibility that this sec- tion of the journey will be further accelerated within two or three months by nnother day. This will be possible as soon as the negotia- tions, now almost completed, between the British nnd Italian Governments, have settled amicably the route to be flown by the Im- perial Airways' services over Italy At present the Italian Government has political objections to any regular air service, other than national, being flown over the southern section of Italy. This has neces- sitated passengers by air routes to or from India or South Africa travelling from Paris to Brindisi by train. With a direct flight from London to the Italian airport to be decided upon, it will be possible to expedite both the Indian and South African service by another day This will bring Singapore within seven davs of London The distance from London to Singapore by air is officially calculated at 8648 miles This will give an average daily flight of slightly less than 1250 miles Some days It would be moie and some less The air journey from Singapore to Sydney is about 4800 On the same basis that flight should not occupy more than four days This would bring Syd- ney within 11 davs of London According to the provisions of the tender schedule submitted by the Federal Govern- ment to tenderers for tile Brisbane-Singapore section of the journey between Australia and London, the manageis of the service may provide for a six days' lourney between Bris- bane and Singapore This gives an average daily flight of slightly over 700 miles This Is considered absuidly low having regard to the speeds of modern commercial aircraft, many of which can make up to 150 miles per hour when carrying an ordinary pay load It Is urged that there is no íeason why, with the approval of the Federal Government, the conti actors foi the new sei vice should not be able to make the Brisbane-Singapore flight within four days making the starting and landing times such as will permit passengers from Sydney to join the outward aeroplane the day of leaving, and on the day of arrival to leave Brisbane In time for Sydney to be reached befoie dark That would give a two-way 11-day service between Sydney and London, which Is the least the users of that service have a right to expect from the Government and tht. organisers of the service Dissatisfaction li felt in aviation and com mciclal circles at the delay of the Federal Government In making an announcement as to vvhen the Brisbane-Singapore section of the service is likely to commence The tender forms provide for an interval of six months for the successful tenderer to organise the service from the date of the acceptance of the tender If the matter be delayed much longer by the Federal Government there Is a possibility that the service will not be organised until the end of the present year.

SSIX DAYS I-I- SLondon to Australia /. ;AIR MAIL ::SERV!CE: SYDNEY, FIriday. Mr. .. AE Rudder, a directorof Qantas Empoire ?A?.irSays' Liiited,.whilch has sccured the ,dingapore-Darwin-Brisbane air mail contract, slated to-day that the conm pany hopedto transport mail and passen gers'from London to Darwin in six days. This could be achieved by eliminating some of the stopping-places now used and by flying at night. ie said thalnt there were at presenct 24 scheduled stoppilng-places between Signa pore and Brisbane, but mauy of the?se were certain to be eliminated in order to reduce time. The passenger traffic avail able from London to Singapore was al ready taxing the accommodation of the Astraea class of monoplances to the ut most. "At present." said Mir. Rludder, "sec tions of the Empire route from London are being equipped for regular night flying, and as a result aeroplanes now flying 800 miles a day will travel for 16 or 20 hoors a day towards Australia. This means that the travelling time will be reduced by more than 50 per cent. The company will require for the Singapore-Brishane service 20 Australians, ten of whom will be 'cap tains' and 10 assistant pilot radlio officers."  AIR MAIL SERVICE London To Sydney IN ELEVEN DAYS The proposal of Imperial Airways Li uiiled to hasten the service between London and Singapore, so as to make a regular eight-day timetable practicable either way, is of the greatest iniport auce to Australia (says the Sydney "Ucral&lt;l"|. There is also the possibility that this section of the journey wilt be further accelerated within two or three mantua by another day. This will be possible as soon as thc negotiations, now ulmusl completed, between the British and Italian Governments, have settled amic- ably the route to be flown by the Im- perial Airways' services over Italy. At present the Italian Government has political objections to any regular air service, other than national, being flown over thc southern section of Italy. This has necessitated passengers by air roules to or from India or South Africa travelling from Paris tb Brindisi by train. With a direct flight from Lon- don to the Italian nil port to be de- cided upon, it will be possilile to ex- pedite both the Indian and Sou'h Afri- can service by another day. This wil! bring Singapore within seven days «I London. Thc distance from London lo Singa- pore by air is officially calculated ut 8(148 miles. This will give an average daily flight of slightly less than I2fl0 nillcs. Home days it would he more and some less. The air journey from Singapore to Sydney is about 4S0D. On thc same basis that flight should not occupy more than four days. This would bring Sydney within ll days of London. BRISBANE-SINGAPORE. According to thc provisions of the lender schedule submitted by the Fed ral Government to tenderers for thc Brisbane-Singapore section of the jour- ney between Australia and London, Hie managers of the service may provide for a six days' journey between Bris- bane and Singapore, This gives an average daily flight of slightly over 700 miles. This is considered absurdly low having regard to the speeds of modern! commercial aircraft, many of which can make up to ISO miles per hour when carrying an ordinary pay load. It is urged that there is 110 reason why, with the approval of thc Federal Government, the contractors for the new service should not be able to make the Brisbnne-Siupipore flight within four days, making the starling und lauding times such ss will permit pas- sengers from Sydney to join the out- ward aeroplane the day of leaving, and on the day of arrival to leave Brisbane in time for Sydney to be rearhnil be- fore dark. That would give iv two ivny 11-day service between Sydney and London, which irs the least the user» of that service have a right to expect from the Government and the organisers of the service. Dissatisfaction j* felt In aviation «nd commercial circles at the delay of the pederal Government in making n;i an- nouncement as to when tin» Brisbane Singapore section of the service is likely to commence. The tenH ? formp pro- vide for «n interval of six months for tlie suceesstul tenderer to organise the sorv'ee from the date of the acceptance of the lender. If the matter be delayed much longer hy the Federal Government there is a possibility that the service will not he organised until the end of the present year. There were anticipa- tions, encouraged by the Government, that the service would be in operation in .Tune next. Tile responsibility for the inaugura- tion of the service now rests with thc Federal Government. There is an aggregate of 6750 miles of railways in the (stats) sf Quean« ?«a>d.  IN SIX DAYS London to Darwin Contractors' Hopes SYDNEY, April 21. Mr. A. E. Rudder, director of (Juantas Empire Airways .Limited, which has secured the Singapore- Darwin-Brisbane air mall contract, stated that the company hoped to transport mall passengers from Lon don to Darwin in six days. This could be achieved by eliminating some of the stopping places now used and by flying at night. He said there were at present 24 scheduled stopping places between Singapore and Brisbane, but many of these were certain to -be eliminated in order to reduce time. He declared that the passenger traffic avail able from London to Singapore was already. taxing the accommodation of the Astrea class of monoplanes to the utmost. "At present," said Mr. Rudder, "sec tions of the Empire route from London are being equipped for regular night flying ana as a result planes now flvlng 800 miles a day will travel for from 16 to 20 hours a day towards Australia. This means that the travelling time will be reduced by more than 50 per cent" The company will require for the Singapore-Brisbane service 20 Austra lians, two of whom will be "captains" and 10 assistant . pilots and radio offi cers. r , Tenders Compared CANBERRA, April 21. A difference of £44,483 lay between two tenders received by the Federal Government for the Singapore-Dar win-Brisbane eectlon of the England- Australia air service. Qantas Empire Airways, who secured the contract, submitted four proposals, and the only other tenderer (the Ulm-Brearley or ganisation) submitted six. The Ulm- Brearley tender for tbe same number of DH. 86 air craft as were offered by Qantas . was f 272,961, against £228,478. AVOID MONOPOLY. The Government separated the Singapore-Darwin-Brisbane and the Brisbane-Charlevllle-Cootamundra ser vices against the advice of the Air Control Committee, which comprised Colonel T. J. Thomas (finance secre tary of the Defence Department), Mr. M. M. Maguire (assistant secretaiy of the Defence Department), Captain E. C. Johnston (Controller of Civil Aviation), and Mr. A. J. Smith (sec retary of tho Contract Board). The committee said tbe tender of Qantas for the complete service (£339,486) was "outstanding and should he ac cepted." In giving the Internal con tract to Mr. A. C. Butler the Gov ernment explained that it desired to avoid any tendency to monopoly.

He said that for the Singapore ser- vice to Australia, 10 captains would be employed and 10 assistant pilota and wireless officers. The captains would have to possess a full naviga- tion certificate. Only three passen- gers would be carried on the Singa- pore-Darwin section owing to the amount of petrol needed to cover thi 514 miles between Keopang and'Dar- win across the Timor Sea. The pas- senger space had to be sacrificed to allow maximum amount of air mail to be carried.  GIRL FLIER LANDS AT MASCOT Wonderful Reception From Huge Crowd 22 Days From London SYDNEY, May 30. Miss Jean Batten, the young New Zealander, who left England on May 8 in a Gipsy Moth plane on her third attempt to fly solo to Australia, had a wonderful reception when she landed at Mascot aerodrome this afternoon on her 22nd day out from London. Despite a blustering hard southerly wind. Miss Batten made a gooa trip from Narromine, which she left at noon. On landing she v-as immedi ately surrounded by cheering crowds. Nearly 4,000 people, in which women predominated, filled the Mascot aero drome at an early hour this afternoon. The air was full of machines of all descriptions circling and waiting for Miss Batten's arrival. When her plane came in sight with the escort, a burst of cheering shook the crowd. There was a strong southerly blowing, but Miss Batten circled gracefully and made a perfect landing. In a moment the plane was the centre of a seeth ing mass of people. Wearing a heavy flying suit and a white helmet. Miss Batten stepped from the machine smiling to face a battery of cameras. Two women, not to be de nied, pushed their way past the .offi cers and. flinging their arms around Miss Batten's neck, kissed her heartily, amid goodnatured applause. The little flier took it all with a delightful smile. Representatives of the State Gov ernment, of the Governor-General, and the Ljeutenant-Governor of New South Wales and high officials of the Army, Navy, and Air Force were on the plat form to welcome her. Miss Batten was wildly cheered when she rose to respond. "I want you all to know now pleased I am to be here this afternoon," she said, "to realise that I am so near my native land, and have accomplished the flight successfully. I arrived in Aus tralia the day before Empire Day. and I hope that my Sight will help to strengthen the great bonds, not only between England and Australia and New Zealand, but also between all the Dominions and colonies' of our great Empire. "On my flight from Darwin to Syd ney I have had with me an escort pro vided by Lord Wakefield. and this is just another example of his generosity, without which I could not have accom plished this flight." Town Hall Welcome Miss Batten was officially welcomed by the Premier (Mr. Stevens) and the Lord Mayor (Aid- Parker) at the Town Hall tonight. In a short speech. Miss Batten paki special tributes to Lord Wakefield, "without -s-hose generosity my flight could not have been accomplished." and her mother who, she said, made sacrifices in order that she might at tain her ambition. Miss Batten's speech was broadcast by 30 stations. Communication vas also made with Sir Charles Kingsford Smith, in San Francisco. Miss Batten thanking him for his cable of conijra tulaticn. She said that she had thought of him that afternoon when crossing Richmond Aerodrome, as it was there, in 1929, he took her up in his historic Soutben Gran lor tan first flight  EIGHT DAYS TO LONDON -__ AIM FOR AIRMAIL SERVICE EXTENSION TO SYDNEY . BY MIDDLE OF 1935 CANBERRA, Wednesday. - The Eng- lish-Australia air mall service will prob- ably be extended to Sydney by June, 1035, and when night flying becomes prac- ticable, it is hoped to reduce the time taken from 14 to eight days. The Minis- ter for Defence (Mr. Parkhill) gave this information in the House of Represen- tatives to-day. Mr. Jennings (U.A.P., N.S.W.), asked whether the Commonwealth hod aban- doned the proposal to make Mascot (Syd- ney) the terminal airport of the service. "I favour the extension of the oversea airmail to Sydney and Melbourne," re- plied "Mr. Parkhill. "Until tho lighting and equipment necessary for night flying are provided on the Australian section of the route, and the Qantas company has gained experience of this section of the service, there will be difficulties." Be- fore the accident to tho Qantas airliner, the company expected that it would be able to extend the service to Sydney early In 1035. It now expects to do so before the middle of 1935. Mr. Garden (Lang Lab., N.S.W.), asked whether Mr. Parkhill could glvo any rea- son for the time occupied having been extended from 13 to 14 days, and whether he could reconcile this delay with his statement in Brisbane that the Ministry's Immediate aim was a seven to eight days' service. Mr. Parkhill replied that the Ministry desired to make the schedule as fast as was practicable. The Commonwealth, however, was responsible only for the sec- tion from SIng-ipore. The Ministry hoped that when experience had been gained and night flying equipment had been in- stalled, It would be possible to obtain a three days' service on this section. It was hoped also that the Singapore-Lon- don service would be accelerated. If that were done, an eight-day time-table should result. It was not possible to obtain in safety and comfort the spectacular times achieved in the Centenary Air Race. He assumed that the British company, like the Qantas company, desired to establish a safe and efficient servlqe before accele- rating it. MACHINES GREETED AT DARWIN Second Section To-day DARWIN (NA), Wednesday - After having flown through tropical storm clouds, the two Qantas Empire Airways aeroplanes, carrying the first Australian airmail over the first section of the route to London landed at Darw in at 2 40 p m (Darwin time) to-day Early ta-morrow morning the mall will be loaded in the Imperial Airways machine Arethusa which will leavo Darwin at 6 30 a m to make the second section of the flight Another Imperial Airways mall 'plane I the Asticn which visited Australia last I year, was duo at Darwin to-day to assist I the Aiethusa to carry the mails to Kara- ' dil, but one of tile landing wheels of I the Astrca was damaged at Koepang yes- ' terdoy and the machine has been delayed The Arcthusn will cany all the mall which weighs a little less than three quarters of a ton Captain ROO Taylor, the pilot of the Arethusa will probably decide lo leave the 'planes' en- gineer (Mr C W Smith) In Dai vin to compensate for the additional weight Captain Taylor is carrying a spare land- ing wheel which he will give to Captain Mollard of the Astrca, when he arrives at Koepang to-morrow The necessary repairs will be made and as the Arethusa will remain in Singapore until Monday morning the Astrea should be able to overtake It It will pick up the ordinary Imperial Airways mail for London at Singapore and both 'planes will fly to Karachi where the malls will be trans- ferred to Hannlbal-type 'planes to be taken to London Before the Qantas 'planes landed at Darwin this afternoon engineers at the aerodrome had to chase away a. laige mob of goats belonging to Fanny Bay gaol which were grazing on the landing ground In the hangai the two pilots -Captain L Brain and Captain G U Allen-were welcomed by the mayor of Darwin (Alderman J H Brogan) other councillors, and the town clcik (Mr R Ley din) The assistant supervisor of mails at Brisbane (Mi W A Martin) and the postmaster at Darwin (Mr J Wes- ton) also welcomed the airmen and offi- cially received the molls  GERMANY'S WOOL SUBSTITUTES Wearing Properties Said To Be Unsatisfactory LONDON. September 26. The wool intelligence section of the Imperial Economic Committee, refer-&lt;*> ring to Germany's wool substitutes, says that the tissues made from them are strong and of good app^arance, out admittedly deficient compared with all wool fabrics. They crease easily, gar ments made from them are ".iable to lose their snaps, and their wearing properties are unsatisfactory. In nor mal times such tissues would be em ployed oniy in the low clothing trade. It is unlikely that they will find an out let in foreign markets unless the price advantage is considerable, which is not the case at the moment. Tile intelligence section also says that, assuming that the maximum ad mixture of artificial fibres with woo 1, re mains at tlie present proportion of 50 per cent., and that the mixture cjuld eventually replace the who:e of Ger many's wool reouirements. the reduced demand for woo; &lt;v tlic present rate of | consuni-:ticn would amount :o lot.' to j 200 million rounds on a creasy basi = ]ie: annum.

London To Sydney IN ELEVEN DAYS The proposal of Imperial Airways Limited to hasten the service between London and Singapore, so as to make a regular eight-day timetable practicable either way, is of the greatest import ance to Australia (says the Sydney 'Heral&'2. Them is also the possibility that this section of the journey will be further accelerated within two or three months by another day. This will be possible at* soon as the negotiations, now almost completed, between the British and Italian Governments, have settled amic ably the route to be flown by the Im perial Airways' services over Italy. At present the Italian Government has political objections to any regular air service, other than national, being flown over the southern section of Italy. This has necessitated passengers by air routes to or from India or South Africa travelling from Paris to Brindisi. by train. With a direct flight from Lou don to the Italian airport to be de cided, upon, it will be possible to ex pedite both the Indian and South Afri can service by another day. This will brine Singapore within seven days of London. The distance from London to Singa pore by air ia officially calculated at 8648 miles. This will give an average daily flight of slightly lees than 1250 miles. Some days it would be more and some less. The air journey from Singapore to Sydney is about 4800. On the same basis that flight should not occupy more than four days. This would bring Sydney within li days of London. BRISBANE-SINGAPORE. According to the provisions of the tender schedule submitted by the Fede ral Government to tenderers for the Brisbane-Singapore section of the jour ney between Australia and London, the managers of the service may provide for a six days' journey between Bris bane and Singapore. This gives an average daily flight of slightly over 700 miles. This is considered absurdly low having regard to the speeds of modern commercial aircraft, many of which can make up to 150 miles per hour when carrying an ordinary pay load. It is urged that there ig no reason why, with the approval of the Federal Government, the contractors for the new service should not be able to make the Brisbane-Singapore flight within four days, making the starting and landing times such as will permit pas sengers from Sydney to join the out ward aeroplane the day of leaving, and on the day of arrival to leave Brisbane in time for Sydney to be reached be fore dark. That would give a two-way 11-day service between Sydney and London, which is the least the users of that service have a right to expect from the Government and the organisers of the service. Dissatisfaction is felt in aviation and commercial circles at the delay of the Federal Government in making an an nouncement as to when the Brisbane Singapore section of the service is likely to commence. The tend- ? forms pro vide for an interval of six months for \he suerepstul tenderer to organise the service from the date of the acceptance of the tender. If the matter be delayed much longer by the Federal Government there is a possibility that the service will not be organised until the end of the present year. There were anticipa tion*, encouraged by the Government, that the service would be in operation in -Tune next. The responsibility for the inaugura tion of the service now rest* with the Federal Government.  MAY LEAVE AGAIN TOMORROW Rush Repairs In Sydney For Lady Southern Cross KINGSFORD SMITH optimistic "Can Reach London In Eight Days" SYDNEY. October 1. Sir Charles Kingsford Smith, whose flight to England to participate in the Centenary Air Race was interrupted by the discovery at Cloncurry of cracks in the aluminium cowling of the en gine of his Lockheed Altair monoplane, returned to Sydney today, landing at Mascot Aerodrome about 1.30 p.m. The flight from Brisbane occupied 4 hours 5 minutes at a speed of 125 miles an hour. Kingsford Smith said tonight he hoped that the new cowling would be fitted to the monoplane in time for tests to be made tomorrow, and that he ex pected to resume his flight to England on Wednesday. As soon as the machine taxied to the hangar, repairs were begun by mecha nics. Before the airmen alighted from the cockpite'the mechanics had re moved sections of the engine casing. Wing-Commander Wackett. a friend of Kingsford Smith, met the plane as it entered the hangar and examined the damage. He said it was obviously a case of fatigue, and had been work ing up for some time. Kingsford Smith is confident that lie can reach London in eight days, and still have time to make life ground ar rangements at the nine places where he intends to land during the race. But. he added, it would be unwise for him and Captain Taytor. his co-pflot and navigator, to over-exert themselves on the way. as the race began on Octo ber 20. and there was much work to be done in England. Neither Kingsford Smith nor Cap tain TaylOE could explain the cause of the. damage to the cowlinc. They agreed with W3ng-Commander Wackefi. that the various 6plit6 which had been no ticed had been caused gradually. but there is a definite dent at the b2sc of the cowling which they cannot explain Kingsford Smith is inclined to believe that it was caused by Tiitting a bird, which they did not see or by a stone flung up by the wheels as they were landing at C'.oncurry. "It is no use being unset." he said. "We have to accent these setbacks Dn:lcsophically. and I can assure you that we will endeavor to win the race. If we can leave by Thursday at the latest, we wOl be able to be in the line up on October 14."  SPEEDED UP! Air Mai! Service London in Thirteen Days Sydney, Wednesday.
