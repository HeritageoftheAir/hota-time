 [?] LINKING UP EUEW1AN, ASIATIC ANP AUSTEAOAM RAILWAYS. SHOHTEMmG TSE RSAlL a©UTE TO LONSOW. By coastmctins 1600 miles of railway line in Persia, and the Transcontinental line in Australia, mails and passengers could reach London from Sydney in 23 days, a saving of seven days on the present f astes t mail route. ('Sunday Times' Special.) 'Sydney to London in 20 Days.' This ideal was set by the 'Sunday Times' some time ago, and pooh-poohed by many Sydney shipping men. 'Impossible !' 'preposterous !' Such were the comments vrhen the sub ject was mentioned. At the time it was conclusively proved that the ideal was quite possible of re alisation. Now, in the light of later de velopments, it is highly probable that we shall soon see its consummation. At the present moment railway lines exist from the western coast of Europe to Baku, on the Persian frontier. Then i there is a gap of 1600 miles, and tracks again to the western coast of India. A proposition has been set on foot by a group of Russian promoters to bridge this gap in Persia, and thus make a con tinuous line from Western Europe to India, giving an i UNINTERRUPTED THOROUGHFARE from the west to the south. Such an enterprise must be international in cha racter, and it is anticipated that sufficient Russian and English backing will be ob tained to carry out the scheme. What does this mean to Australia ? The most rapid transit for mails and passengers yet suggested. Given the moderate average speed of S3 miles per hour, Bombay could be reafciicsd from London in exactly seven days. Given a fast line of steamers, travelling at an average sseed of 18 knots aa hour, Fremantle could be reached in 10 days from Bombay. Here Australia's part of the scheme comes in, and the construction of a trans continental line is involved. With improvements in locomotion, the route will be made quicker, until the goal of London to Sydney in 20 days is reach ed.  'Frisco Mail Service. PRQBABL.B RESUMPTION.
