 London to Sydney in 28 days. Some time ago (says the Auckland Evening Star) our London correspondent stated that ere long arrange mente would probably be perfected whereby ihe con veyance of mails between London and Auckland would be accomplished within from 28 to 30 days. The prospect seemed too alluring to be altogether real, but Mr. Boucicault (who was a passenger by the Zealandia yesterday) informs us that Mr. Pcarce, on behalf of Messrs. Elder and Company, has sent in to -the Government an offer to place the steamers Alaska and Arizona on the line between San Francisco and Auckland and Sydney, carrying out with them a forked service from Fiji. Both steamers are now in the trans-Atlantic trade, and are recognised ocean greyhounds. By means of them Mr. Pearce undertakes to do the service from London to Sydney in 28 days, and from London to Auckland in 27 days. Mr. Bouci cault VhJT*Vft that the Imperial Government should sub sidise this sendee, and in the letters which he has been engaged ia write for the London Times he intends to strongly advocate the justice and expediency of such a contribution.  From Sydney to London in 28 Days- TiiKyLonilon corrospotidont of rlw New Zealand Herald writott: —" Mr I'onrco, of John lildor and Co., .who in tlio owner of tlio Xctnlandia nnd Australia, while in London recently conversing with a load ing New Zoftland colonist, said ho wos prepared to negotiate for placing tho Alaska and Arizona on tbo Pacific sor vico for a fitting consideration. Those steamers havo been hitherto running in -tbo.:_Atlantic trade uudor tho Qaion flng, and havo won extraordinary fauio for tho rapidity of their passages, the Alaska being cnllod tbo ' greyhound of tbo Atlantic. , As it is understood that tho Gnion lino is on the eve of being ab sorbed in the Cunard Company, Poarco will resume his boats, and of cpiirso naturally.doairos a now sphoro for them wilh fair: promises of ultiniato success. Ho ..-states that bo would undcrtako to condnct a service between London nod Sydney in 28 days, nnd between London nnd Aucklnnd in 25. This be, would do for a subsidy of '£00,0.00 a year, if three colonies would become contribn tory to; tbo ox ton t of £lio,ooo each. As such a service would wholly eclipse "anything-''iha't is otherwise poseinlo botwpon the. Awstralasion colonies and England, tbo proposnl is otio that desorves serious consideration.
