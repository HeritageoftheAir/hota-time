In csthnatiug &lt;ie cost of such a service the freight rate as determined from a tJ'PKa! ship now running in the Australian trade, -was increased b\- 75 ipec cent, to al\>w for the consideration that the new Kiiips would carry only careo &lt;ll the highest Frade and to do so at efreater speed.

Hence, the sub sidy for a tATO->*i?*lv service would be in the rosdon of £450.01W per annum. In considering these figores, however, it must be borne in mind, lie remarks, that the. cort of carryijvr tlie Australian ntiils is at present about £-360.000 pox annum, and that espendlturp is incurred on account nf assist^ po?Kic?i.

Sir John Biles ref?-s to two considerations of importance. One is the prwit srvpe for economy of operation af forded by reduction of the time spent in I?rt. The other is ihat^. while Kiie sus restei 70CMft. ship has been outlined on th* bssis Dihat l'tiel is taken on board at bwo intermediate porU (say Port Said and L"o;orr,V>) and water at one. if'fue! couM be takon on board at Fremantle in addi lion and water at two or three intermedi ate ports, the total d?ad weitrht to be liarrixi oouM be approciabir mlaced, and it might be possible to fulfil tbe main re nuiremenls xitb a ship rather smaller, and therefore cheaper than than the 700-ft. ship. The iaiportaure of fretting the smaller* capable chip lies in tbe fact that the charges on revenue that depend on Rr?t cost ar&lt;> much the largoat item, on [?He expenditure side, of tbe running ac count. ?
