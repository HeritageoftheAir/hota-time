 LONDON STREET ACCIDENTS. rival to sydney's red roll. action by home; secretary. ! 9 deaths in 12 days. "Nine deaths were caused by motor-omni buses in the streets ,of the .metropolis dur ing the first twelve days of this month," said Mr. M'Kenna, In the House of Commons. "Each case, ivill, bo. the subject of . a, coroner's InquesL and in the event of negligence be- ing proved criminal proceedings would' be taken against the person guilty of negli- , gence." The question arose as to whether the re latives of persons killed by motor-omnl- 'buses and tramway-cars should have the . benefit of an inquiry in addition to the coroner's Inquest, the suggestion being made by Mr. Kellaway. Mr. M'Kenna replied that all the circum stances ought to be brought out at the coro ner's Inquest. "But is it not a fact," urged Mr. Kella way, "that in a great many of these cases where the person killed was poor the de pendents were not able to be representeft5 by - counsel, while the motor-omnibus comprihldis always haye counsel present?" , Mr.- M;Kenna remarked that the coroner was there to protect the puDIie. - The Home Secretary further announced that for .offences connected with excess of speed or dangerous driving the prosecutions in the metropolitan police district In 1911 were: — Against drivers of motor cabs or omni buses .....; (893 Against drivers of other motor vehicles' 3,555 "The enforcement of the Motor-car Acts presents many difficulties, " he added, "but the whole question is engaging, my mpst careful. attention; and I am issuing instruc tions with a view to better differentiation between the more and the less -serious classes of offence, and to the more stringent enforcement of the section which deals with dangerous, reckless, or negligent driving. "Reckless driving at a crossing would certainly justify proceedings under that sec tion, but the evidence of the constable show ing that the driving was reckless Is often contradicted by the evidence of the driver or occupants of the car. Members of the public can give useful assistance by tender ing themselves as witnesses on such an oc casion." A suggestion that Government-owned cars fitted with speedometers should be en gaged to pursue and test the speed of vehicles suspected of excessive speed was not accepted by the Home Secretary, who 'de clared that such an experiment "would In evitably result in increasing the number of accidents."  ? , ? — ? , ? — ? . ? _ ? . ? — - _ ______ _ : ... : __ ___ . - r ?...?? ^ ? ?-? .-? ? - -.???? ... .-; .. :. : ; :.-? -, : . ?? ? ; ;? - ... - -.. , . .

I j jg __JL 'CSS* kj^/5^48 VjtSi* *wo y®81^ ago the 'Sunday flUi Times' put forward the plea for the J Ili I inauguration of a twenty-days' steam l^dffl serv*CQ between Sydney and London. Engineers, shipping men, and experts, while admitting the scheme was possible of aciiievement, saw difficulties in the way. There are still difficulties, bat the; axe not insurmountable. On fnel is to bring the 'Sunday Times' slogan, 'Sydney to London in twenty days,' intn thA realm nf aphiAVpmpnt { At 22 knots 1000 tons of coal will carry a steamer 1200 miles. At the same speed 1000 tons of oil fuel will take a. steamer 2000 miles. : It is _e internal combustion engine, proved a commercial success in the motor-liner Selandia, t_t is going to do the trick for us, however. ? For, at 22 knots, 1000 tons of oil fuel used ' in internal combustion engines, will take a i motor liner 5400 miles. ; Now, 5400 miles is the distance from Ply \ month to Capetown, and another 1000 tons of oil fuel taken, on there would bring the liner to Albany. ! At _ knots It is 19£ days' steaming from Albany to London, via South Africa. At the same speed it is 202 days' steaming from London to _elbourne, via the Suez CanaL If express train travelling is substituted from Sydney to West Australia, and from Marseilles to London, the trip, via Suez, can be done in under twenty days. i Via Panama the same thing applies, as It does also from Sydney to Vancouver, thence across Canada and the Atlantic to London. ?With 25-knot motor liners the transit periods ^Quld be cut down by several days, but '22 knots is a fair __tog-. and will suffice if we can ..get it ' . ' This, then, Is what the internal combustion £Qg— 3 will do .for Australia alone. It is In regard to the navy, however, that oil !b going to work the greatest revolution. Apart, from the Internal combustion engine, tie use of oil for furnace work instead of coal b the British navy will at once nullify the bdvantage that rests with Great Britain to day In the possession of a world-wide chain of coaling stations. ] On the other hand, however, a warship will be able to take in oil on any part of the high : seas from a tank steamer. i A pipe will be run- between the two vessels, which may be moving through the seas at i full speed, and the liquid fuel will be pumped - into. its receptacles on the fighting unit. ? As the weight of oil as against coal re quired to steam a certain distance is greatly : m favor of the former, warships will be able ? to cover a wider field without replenishing ] their bunkers, or the saving in weight fuel i will enable the gun and armor experts to in crease the fighting power of the ships. Dr. Diesel, the inventor of the engines fitted in the motor liner Selandia, said : 'The radius : of a man-o'-war fitted with these engines will be such that the ship will sail all over the world, fight any battle, and come home, with out having to take in one pound of fuel on the way.' ,..u..-^,. ..... This, of course, refers to the internal com bustion engine alone. That has not been gene rally adopted in the British navy yet. The trouble is to build cylinders that will take the awful strain. It will come, however, per haps in a few months' time, perhaps in a year. Oil as a fuel in lieu of coal has ar rived, and the United States battleship Dela ware, by carrying 400 tons of oil fuel, in creased her all-coal radius of steaming by not less than 1000 miles. The American navy has found oil fuel nearly 50 per cent, more efficient than coal, and the naval experts of the United States estimate that 91b of oil will perform the service of 141b of coaL With the use of oil, fuel the stokehold of a battleship will, in the words of an expert, 'be a .paradise, while the stokehold where steam has to .be raised by coal is literally hell.' But of far more importance., still where oil fuel is used in a battleship, only 30 hands are required for attending to the oil fuel, as com pared to the 300 required when coal has, to be fed to the furnaces. '? In the fleet of twenty Dreadnoughts now afloat that would be a saving of 5000 men sufficient to man over half a dozen/ battleships, and England to-day wants men more . than anything else.. Already much has been done in the British I aayy to meet this development. ' In 1910 100,000 tons of oil fuel were stored, md last year no less than 400,000 tons were added. A Royal Commission, presided over by Ad miral Lord Fisher, is now inquiring into the whole question, for the change and all it por tends is on us. The record coaling feat of the British navy is held by the battleship King 3dward VII, which took in 1450' tons in three and a half hours. With oil, an equivalent in steam-power could have been put on board in 15 minutes. From dead cold furnaces steam can be raised in twenty minutes with oil; with coal it takes three-quarters of an hour to get the ?? same result. ? s What the latest motive power will mean to our fighting ships.
