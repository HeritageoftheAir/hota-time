""Practical, Spontaneous and Universal"" Response From Vatican City and from Catholic Action organizations in Europe and America relief in money and goods is pouring into the flood areas of Holand, Belgium and Britain. In addition, relief teams have been rushed to the evacuee centres and were at work there within a few days of the catastrophe. The speedy mobilization of resources by the French Catholic Aid organization, Secours Catholique, and Italy's Catholic Action, together with the instant and efficacious response of the Pontifical Assistance Commission, has greatly impressed the whole populations of the stricken countries. In Sydney the St. Vincent de Paul Society is handling the relief appeal and in Melbourne the Catholic Welfare Organization has already sent a shipment of goods and, as reported last week, is urgently appealing for clothing, tinned foods, and donations in cash.
