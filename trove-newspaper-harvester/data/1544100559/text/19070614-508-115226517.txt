 Tfl-DAT'S COfflfflEMAL. * ? » WHEAT CHEAPER. IN SYDNEY AND LONDON. Splendid rainsihave fallen in Riverina, the West, and other parts o£ N.S.W..; oyer the Darling Downs, ? Queensland; over -the Wim mera, the Mallee, and the Cfoulburn Valley, in Victoria; and over the wheat areas in South Australia and. West Australia. These rains have put a different complexion on the cereal ?position, as the Australian harvest next sum mer is assured, so far as ^concerns the plough ing and seeding. The change in the weather has brought out many, sellers, f.a.q., -wheat be ing freely offered from farms and country rail -way- stations to Sydney at the -equivalent of 3s 9d a bushel (Sydney). ; . Private cables indicate that the London -vrheat market has relapsed, and tb.e buyers at Mark lane are holding aloof, believing that the re cent spurt in the Chicago 'pit' and in New York was founded on exaggerated statements, assiduously disseminated by the 'bulls,' con cerning damage by frosts, etc,, to Canadian and United States . crops ... . . . JUNEE WHEAT PROSPECTS - Advices from Junee state that many of the far mers in that district are now willing to sell the balance of last wheat harvest to Sydney. The rains have well developed all the crops sown - prior to the break in the weather, and the early Bown look healthy. : Mild vsather now pre vails, and, if it lasts for ten days longer, it will, compensate for so many of the crops being sown rather late'. These remarks concerning Junee are typical of the position of the N.S.W. wheat areas gen erally. The Bathurst District has had a most serviceable downpour. The weakness of bran an-\ pollard tends to keep flour in Sydney fairly strong. The quotes for N.S.W. flour are also sustained by the ex ports leaving Sydney week by week for New Zealand. The official estimate ' of the N.S.W. wheat yield is now stated to have been in excess of the actual yield by about three million bushels. The value of this information was discounted a couple of months ago by readers of this column. MAIZE ON ITS MERITS! Complaints are rife among the northern river farmers that the Sydney quotes for maize are ofien unfair to the grower, who; takes care to select the ? best seed, who keeps his -ground . clean, who cultivates the best article, suitable for cattle-feed, and who consigns to Sydney his finest samples of grain. At present there are three grades of yellow maize arriving from the rivers. A small ' percentage is prime, ' and should therefore get a special price. A large percentage is already touched with . weevil. Some grain is pinched, and injured by bad ?weather during harvest. . Many bags contain' some bitter grains; and, as a horse ejects these from the manger, and often will spit out whole mouthfuls of good grains, because of two or ihree bitter ones, the waste is serious. Far mers say that the cash returns from Sydney are sometimes based on the general - average of quality. This' should not be. Occasionally such a basis- may tempt holders outside of Sus sex-street to palm off the inferior quality at ihe same price as the best. FALL IN LUCERNE. The rains all over New South Wales have fur ther depressed the city values of Hunter River lucerne by about 10s a ton. Prime dry. green is £4 on Sydney wharf. . Brown and heated samples proportionately. OATS DEPRESSED. Now that soaking rains have fallen, owners of Jive stock inland are making shift with the chaff already bought from Sydney, supplement ed by the tender blades of young grass. Con eequently the demand for Algerian and white leod oats has lessened, and prices for |Nsw. . _€outh Wales-. -Victorian, ^and ..^asmanian ' are. -r lbv.tr. ' '' '. ; . ?.'.'?.''.. ': ' ''. . .. ? ...-. -EGGS AGAIN CHEAPER- ' ^ ?Supplies of eggs from rivers, South -Coast, and Sydney suburbs are 'fairly plentiful for the . time of year, ar.d prices further receded. From 4000 to 5000 dozen eggs |lrom Adelaide . jire expected to reach Sydney next week. BETTER TALE FOR FRUIT. The return of warm weather' for winter has Slightly stimulated the dc-_and: for oranges, lemons, mandarins, passionfrult,. and pine-, apples. Custard-apples, of best - quality sell readily at high prices. The turnover in cook ing apples is considerable. LONDON BUTTER MARKET. Messrs. Dalgety and Company write from London, Uay 9, that the principal increase in butte'r supplies ? was expected from Siberia, *'where the industry is growing considerably, and is a feature to be reckoned with. Siberia lias large pastoral resources. Many factories, have been erected there on the Danish prin ciple, and installed by Danish experts.' The New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Company writes, under date London, May 10, ' that the demand for absolutely best butter has further improved, .v:ith*the result that stocks of the very choicest Australian and New Zealand -had been well, cleared at previous fates, and parcels of superfine were being booked to arrive. Second qualities were slow. Messrs . Gibbs, Bright . and Company, writing . from London on May 9, state that Continental makes of butter had advanced 2s to 3s per cwt. The quality of Siberian butters showed a big improvement on the previous season. English merchants who used to. refuse to handle Si berian butter bad begun to push it among their - customers. The demand for:, superfine Aus tralian was -active. - ? ? THE HORSE MARKET. ?? Pitt, Son; :and Badeerv..
