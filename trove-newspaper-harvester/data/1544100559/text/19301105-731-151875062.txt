My'rocqrtl of 13'^ayg will go, and I'p^ore very long, -iob- I .knew thai w'jen I' brought : th& 'bus -?ou-n at 2Caseot.0n.'WeGi-efday-.iEind 1 am quito coqfent that it ahonld^o.

JJijiifl, resting *»o .'tlixlZjic would Ibo I ready to muke the roturn trip with | the Sydney-bound mail to Darwin tbe I I day after the other pilot landed it at i | Uima. It would only be two days' ' I wcrk a week for the' pilots, with a I | woekly air avrvice, ! .which would be : t|uite enough. There is no reason, , however, why an aeroplane should |do I only one stage- A couple of stages | would be quite reasonable for any | good machine, and still leave it idle I three days o week for repairs at the I ricrodrome. To start such a service a | ? ompany would need half-a-doseu I luaehineu, to allow' for one being laid tp occasionally. | The 10-day ma'fl idea is no idle dream. It ir a fact of to-morrow, and It only needs someono with a bit of foresight and capl&fcl to put it tLrough. A liassengcr-carryiug service on the tame Hues and usjug tbe same route, is only impoaaible .to«day because tbe l)ig. passenger carriers Are not fast enough. Our big , machines do 100j unlet? an bout. Experiments are bc*ng carried out in Ameriea'at the present time, and big three-engihed moebines hjjve been built which are capable of 320 and 130. , . It is ftill not enough., They have gpt to come up to the 150 mark, and. until they., do,- the prospect of ibe passenger service ia on ithe ki'ces of ,(bp inventors. With 10 -Louth' flying, our present machines' have only a ipng?. of , ,,1000 miles a.i day, and it is not a -bii of use start* j j rig a pasMngey serVice to Loodon-- which takes longer than 10 days. :j 6tiII, the three-enjgined fast ma-; chines will come.Jj^ore long, . aod^ then passeng^ flignfe will become a I reality. Jt nopr.dosts & /i&J- t9 fly to j Brisbane, wliieh, ( one stage -aod a short one) of. 'a Sz-fl&ge flight 1 1, London. However, vi. do not think it would be reaaonable to multiply £9/13/- by IS; a-ti something to allow lor the shortness of tbe first stage, snd say that each passenger would lave to pay about £150 to go to Lon* aon. 1 think it could be done for. less. Our Sydney-Brisbane fare has to cover the cost of a tremendous' ground organisation in both cities to, ciaints^n a . daily service — a weekly, «crrfce,. wpuld not reqittir' so niahy. meebanics or suclL.lar^e hangars.
