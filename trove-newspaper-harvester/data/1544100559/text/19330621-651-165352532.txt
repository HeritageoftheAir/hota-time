 To London in Five Days 9 . ? ULM STARTS SYDNEY, Wednesday. The monoplane, Faith in Australia,' took off from Richmond aerodrome to-day on an adventurous flight on which, before the crew, return, they may circumnavigate the globe. HUNDREDS of friends and rela tives witnessed the take-off, which was made in perfect stylo, after a remarkably short run of 800 yards across the 'drome. The machine gained height rapidly, in spite, of her load of more than 80C gallons of petrol, and headed straight across the mountains for Derby. During the parting scenes, which were full of warmth, bystanders wore moved by the touching farewell be tween Charles Ulm, the commander of the flight, and his young son, Ulm could face no more farewells after that. Ho quickly climbed into the cockpit and stayed there. Mrs. Ulm and Mrs- Taylor also figured in affecting scenes. In a farewell message, Ulm said that he felt that tho trip would be something like a glorious holiday. 'The machine is as perfect as we can make it,' he said. It Is believed that Ulm has laid down a plan which should land him in London in live days. After a rest of a day or so In England, he may fly from England to America, down through Honolulu to New Zealand, and back to Sydney Ho could do it in leas than a month International flying has become so regular that the CuBtoms authorities have devised printed schedules and manifests for aeroplanes in the same way as for steamships. Thus it wan that Mr. Ulm had to sign here and there and swear to this and that, while Government of ficials crawled all over tho 'Faith In Australia.' . .. ? ?
