 WIRELESS TELEPHONY SYDNEY TO LONDON Satisfactory Test Sydney, August 12. Important experiments in duplex wireless telephony between Australia and England were inaugurated to-day by the managing director of Amalga mated Wireless (Mr. E. T. Fisk). Conversation was carried on with engineers in London, who were speak-&lt;*> ing from a building in Queen Victoria-&lt;*> street for the first test the result was considered satisfactory, bat not what would be required far a commercial service. The duplex test will continue for-some weeks, after which the en gineers at both ends will compare notes and make arrangements for'more_tesia. The purpose of the experiments is to determine an the technical debate necessary for. a public service. Ho in dication can be given at present when such a, service may be established, be cause much technical data has to be collected before the permanent equip ment can be designed and established. Amalgamated Wireless has conducted many successful experiments in two way wireless telephony with Rji,TJJSA, Java, Holland, and Germany. The sta tions and plant used for these experi ments were designed and manufactured in Australia by Amalgamated Wireless engineers. Officials in other countries have commented favorably cat the effi ciency of the Australian transmissions, and have stated that the results are in every way as good as on the recently established wireless telephone service between Europe and South America.
