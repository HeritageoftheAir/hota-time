 POPULAR AIRSHIP TRAVEL. London to Sydney in Five Days. At a recent meeting in the Central Hall, Westminster, Mr. G. Holt Thomas delivered a lecture on com mercial aeronautics, he said that in his opinion aeronautics would revo- lutionise the world not only from a commercial point of view, hut from a humanitarian point, much more than it had revolutionised warfare. He was not one of those who thought that commercial aeronautics vera going to beat out of existence railways and other forms of transport, but rather that flying would add as an adjunct to the presont modes of transport. Aviation having suffered In the past from mero discourage ment, tho people of this country must see to it that In the future it was fully encouraged. From the busi ness point of view speed was every thing. A special aeroplane, in the sense of a special train, would enable a business man to leave London in the morning, do his business In Paris, be home again to dmner. It would take him to Bagdad In a day and a half, or to New York in two days. Ceylon would become two and three- quarter days from London ; Tokio 46 days ; Sydney five days ; Cape Town 36 days ; Vancouver three days. Many business men would smile at tho Idea of. using this mode of conveyance, but the only thing was. to remind them that they also smiled In the early days of motor-cars, and yet half the business to-day would take double the time to do if the motor-car was not in existence. . As for the question of cost, it. would be possible to run a pro fitable air service between London and Paris at £5 per passenger, 6d. per ounce for mails, and 2s. each for par cels of 3 lbs. Constantinople, or Mos cow, a journey of 24 hours, might in volve a cost of £25 per ticket.
