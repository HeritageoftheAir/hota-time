 EXCHANGE RATES INCREASED London and Australia BANKERS' CONFERENCE Sydney, October 8. Banking problems and the na-&lt;*> tional economic and financial posi-&lt;*> tion were discussed at length at the conference of representatives of an the chief banks at the Com-&lt;*> monwealth Bank Offices to-day and yesterday. The conference is regarded as one of the most momentous in the financial history of the Commonwealth. Fur- &lt;*> ther informal individual discussions are expected before the delegates de part. All tbe discussions were in camera, and tbe only decision made pub lic was tbe increase to take effect from to-morrow in exchange rates to tbe extent of £2 10/ per cent, in tbe tele graphic transfer selling rate, Sydney on London. Tbe Governor of the Commonwealth Bank (Mr. E. C. Riddle) stated after the conference that the results of the discussion and the advantages expe rienced through co-operation were likely to lead to conferences much more frequently in tbe future. Telegraphic Transfers As a result of the conference, new rates of exchange, Australia on London and London on Australia, nave been arranged. Telegraphic transfers will be sold on London at the rate of £109 Australia, for £100 London; as com pared with £106 10/' Australia, for £100 London. Ruling from March 24 last, the rates now superseded had for a long time been nominal Business had been done on the basis of £108 10/ for telegraphic transfers. Tele graphic transfers on London by the new scale will be purchased at £108 10/ Australian money, for £100 English money. Tbe margin between the buy ing and celling rate is 10/, compared with the previous margin of 7/6. Bates are now quoted on tbe basis of £100 London, in place of a stated pre mium or a stated discount, as tbe case might be. Thus. London on Aus tralia, on the new rate, has a tele graphic transfer, selling at £100 Eng lish money for £108 10/ Australian, in the previous rates £93 17/6 English was quoted as the telegraphic transfer cell ing price for £100 Australian. Season for Change The changes have been made to bring the rates into conformity with market conditions, and to keep the ex change business, so far as. possible, in the hands of tbe banks, so that the provision of £36.000,000 for Government purposes in London from tbe export funds may be less hardly accom plished. There is always a fair amount of exchange business which passes the banks by, but lately importers, finding themselves rationed in their London finance requirements by tbe banks, have sought out exporters; and have done business with them.
