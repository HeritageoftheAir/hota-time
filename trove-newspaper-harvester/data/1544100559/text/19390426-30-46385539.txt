 FASTER AIR SERVICE. FORECAST FOR 1942. London to Sydney in Three Days. MELBOURNE, April 25.-Slr Donald Banks, Permanent Under-Secretary for Air in Great Britain and one of the three members of the British air mis sion to Australia, said today that aero planes which would be able to cover the distance between London and Sydney in three flays were now being built in Eng land. They were land planes capable of a speed of 250 miles per hour for a range of 2,000 miles. On such a service, Sir Donald Banks said, planes would have to fly day and night and make only six calls during the trip for refuelling. They would be big enough to accommodate 12 passen gers day and night and mall. It was not Intended that this service should supersede the existing flying boat ser vice, which was both comfortable and popular. The new service would be used and recognised entirely as a special ex press for passengers and mail. Because of lack of planes it would not be pos sible when the service was inaugurated to maintain a regular service to a strict schedule. The type of plane -to be used would have its first tests over the Atlan tic from Croydon (England) to America in allout a year. It Is suggested that the planes will be ready for the Australian service in 1942. Sir Donald Banks left for England by the Orford today. He said that Aus tralia had made more than satisfactory progress in all channels of civil avia tion
