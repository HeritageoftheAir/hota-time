 HUMAN STORIES "BnAMATIC DAYS AT TIIE OLD BAILEY," by OhfirlcK, KtnRlon. (London, Stnnley FttUl; Sydney, Angus nnd Kdbertson). 12/0 The industry of Mr. Kinsston, who now has several hooks to his credit, here finds ample scope, for surely the Old Bailey offers a wealth of material to a writer whose chief fancy is iot Mocieiy KiueijKnis ami reminiscences or I more or less famous trials. As to thd | value of this work, there will he divided opinions. Certainly, however, Mr. Kingston has a distinct Hair for thd hunian side of these events, and no one will deny his powers as a story teller. Tliis book is packed with good tales. ' There was an occasion -whbn a bar rister was pleading for leniency to his client on the ground that the man was an orphan. "Excuse me. Mr. Blank," said the judge, "hut I fail to see what tile fact of your client being an orphan has to do with the case. He has ob viously arrived at that timo of life when the loss of one's parents is natural nnd only to be expected. Why, I cannot ho older than the accused, and I um an orphan, too." "Quite so, my lord," said counsel, In his suavost manner, "and X trust that should your lordship ever have the misfortune to lie brought hetorCa jury of your fel low-countrymen that fact will bo taken into consideration." But . his lordship had the last word, and the "orphan" in the dock received seven years' penal servitude. Incidentally, it Mr- King ston does not chronicle a judge in the dock, he comes near to it by telling of nn ex-governor of a prison who got six months for burglary. An interest ing literary reminiscence in the book relates to Sir W. S. Gilbert, who, it is said, had himself technically listed US one of the counsel for the defence in a murder trial in order to escape jtiry service, A short time previously the famous playwright had been called on some trifling cases when he was in the throes of a new comedy.
