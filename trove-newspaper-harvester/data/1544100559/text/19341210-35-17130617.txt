 'AIR MAIL BEGUN. ! √ç' Il -. First Tlanes from London. SYDNEY MAIL DESPATCHED. To-day's Historic Ceremony in Brisbane. LETTERS TO BE DELIVERED BEFORE CHRISTMAS. The air mail between England and Australia is in operation. Two Imperial Airways' 'planes left Croydon on Saturday with two tons of mail, half a ton for Australia and New Zealand. Last night, 19,166 mail items, weighing 4701b, from New South Wales, and 5000 from New Zealand, left Sydney by the Melbourne express for Coota- mundra, from where the first 'plane from New South Wales will take off this morning. The actual ceremony inaugurating the service from this end will take place in Brisbane this morning, when the Duke of Gloucester will despatch two 'planes from Archerfield aerodrome. The journeys each way will take 13 days, and the mails will arrive hi England and in Australia before Christmas. The Controller of Civil Aviation (Captain Johnston) said last night that the extension of the service to New Zealand was under consideration. The managing director of Qantas Empire Airways (Mr. Hudson Fysh) expects that 'planes of the D.H.86 type (tests of whose airworthiness were ordered following two recent mail 'plane disasters in Australia) will be de- clared fit for service and will be operating between Darwin and Singapore in a few weeks.
