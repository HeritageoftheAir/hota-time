 "NOT CONSENTING, PARTY." Wed to Save Friend. NOW CLAIMS MARRIAGE WAS NOT LEGAL. SYDNEY, November 27. One of the strangest stories ever heard in the Divorce Court was told to Mr. Justice K. W. Street to-day, when Marie Ellen Watson, of View Street, Annandale, asked for a decree for the nullity of her marriage with William Brice Lon- don, of Nelson Street, Annandale.' The petitioner alleged that she was not really a consenting party to the performance of the marriage ceremony but was induced to be a party to it, under duress, by reason of fraud, mis- representation, or mistake. In evidence the petitioner said she had met the respondent at a weekly dance, and they became friends. Her mother was dead, and she had few friends. The respondent had told her that he had been drawing the wages of a married man for about three years, and that his employer, having some doubt, had asked him to produce his marriage certificate. The respondent told her there was no necessity for them to live together, and that after a few days she could get a divorce STRANGE AGREEMENT. An agreement was tendered in evi- dence in which it was stated that the petitioner's reason for marrying the respondent was to save him from being charged with theft and false pretences for having stated that he was a mar- ried man while single, and received a married man's wages from his em- ployer. Later she went to a Metho- dist parsonage, where she went through the marriage ceremony with the respondent. In reply to his Honour the petitioner said she did not think, in the circum- stances, that the marriage was legal. His Honour reserved his decision.
