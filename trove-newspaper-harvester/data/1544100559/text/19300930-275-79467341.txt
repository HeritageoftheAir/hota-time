 LONDON TO SYDNEY SIX-DAY AIR SERVICES RELAYS OF AEROPLANES (Special to 'The Daily News') ? LONDON, September 29. A scheme for a London-Sydney air mail service in six days is being dis cussed,' says the 'Evening News' ' aeronautical correspondent. . The idea involves the use of relays of machines, each flying 2000 miles non-i stop, the last stage to the Australian coast being done by a .seaplane. The use of Fairey long-range mono planes is suggested. This would be the most expensive and it is considered Puss-Moths would serve at least in the beginning.
