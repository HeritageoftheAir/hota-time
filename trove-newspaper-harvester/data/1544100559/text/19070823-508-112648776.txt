' ' The new duties on timber -mean -a- rise- all round by 2s 6d per 100 , feet. Consequently, the price of butter boxes. Has been: raised in Victoria by 2%d per box, making the .new rangp from Is 4d to is 4%d each. ' This'; is equivalent to an extra. tax of £10,000 on the' butter producers -of Victoria.' . . The N.S.W. butter producers are similarly interested, as a great number of them, will continue to use New Zealand -pine only, where as, tbe new impost was designed to -foster tbe sale of Queensland pine. : ? : . A further advance is - noted in . the. Sydney wheat market, buyers offering 3s lO&d per bushel during tbe forenoon for f.a.q. samples, I and holder's asking 3s ll%d. .. The improve ment is due partly to the dry conditions ' pre vailing in many of the wheat districts of- New South Wales and Victoria, and partly to the receipt of private cables stating that Hark Lane has advanced by Is 3d per quarter (eight bushels) since Monday. ?-.--- MAIZE FIRM.' ' ' '.', Holders of northern river maize, absolute ly free from weevil, continue to ask ,2s lOd a bushel; and full*gra^ned milling white ' is worth 2s 9d. ' '-'.'?''.''. THE RICHMOXD BUYING MAIZE... ' The Clarence River steamer brought only ? a few dozen bags of maize to Sydney, '- in 'place of the 800 to 1000 bags usual at this date of the year. The Clarence River farmers are using most of their stocks of maize to teed locally to cattle, horses, pigs, and poultry; and are sending a. considerable . quantity.; oj the grain to. the Richmond. River, . . .-.-.. Dry weather on the Richmond lias exhausted thp season's local crop of maize, and the far mers there .pay more attention nowadays ?; to dairying and stock raising than to maize growing. ? ?'.-':? r ??..-.. Nearly every steamer that has left Sydney 0 ii ring the last Tour weeks' for the Richmond Kiver has taken maize as part cargo. : The Manning. Macleay, ' Nainbucca, ' and - Bel linger hve fared better- this season than the Richmond for rain, and are better off for natural herbage. ? , . / ?'.-?'-' QUEENSLAND MAIZE DIVERTED: Another hardening .factor o* .'the Sydney maize market is ' the fact that large quantir ties , of .southern Queensland v maize, in- place of -..being, railed .from Wallangarra by the NvS.iVP'.. northern line, .are:, being sent, do Roclthampton, Cooktovrn, and other ports -in the far north. . ?_ . . ; ? . JUTE FABRICS DEARER. ? Private cablete indicate a fractional 'rise in the Calcutta jute. market, and this is fully. re- fleeted in Sydney. * ' ' ? ' ? Oornsacks, spot lots, Sydney, 6s 3*£d a dozen.

Some of the 'Australian 'makers of butter boxes from New Zealand pine had entered into con tracts for delivery during the whole of the^cur rent season, say, until the end of June, 1908, and Fone makers, contend, that the ? buyers ?will have to pay the new duty in addition to the old rate; An advance of 25 per cent. i6 probable in fruit rases, rabbit cases and potato and onion export cases. ' ??''.. EGGS IN DEMAND,' The biscuit makers are buying eggs freely, and most of the northern' river brought 7d' a dozen wholesale. ? TURKEYS FOE' CAPETOWN. A large consignment of- N.S.W. -turkeys has been dispatched for South- Africa ? and - Sydney prices for hens and gobblers have ? advanced. WOOL REPORT.. '?'? Goldsbrough, Mort, and Company, Limited, report: — A very firm market ruled at the auc tion sales held on Thursdaj-, competition being keen for all good greasy and scoured parcels, at. prices slightly in advance of last month's rates.
