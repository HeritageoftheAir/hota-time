 AUSTRALIA TO LONDOI. A SIX-DlAYS' SOHE DU . SIB 068 SMITH'S FORECAST Sydney, Feb. 15. In a joint interview today Sir Ross Smith and Sir Keith Smith discussed the osgibilities of rapid serial transit between hrope and Australia. They pointed that what had been accomplished by them, as pioneers in 18 days, would in a short time with ease and comfort, be accomplished in a week. Both aviators were reluctant to give an exact rcute which might be fol lowed, as a number of international questions were involved. But they con sidered that the following would be rea sonable daily stages,. wiich might be cov ered by regular services in a series of re lays, flying to be done in daylight hours only. and passengers to sleep at landing places: -First day Sydney to Darwin; second day, Darwin to Singapore; third day Singapore to Calcutta; fourth day, Calcutta to Bagdad; fifth day, Bagdad to Rome; sixth day, Rome to London. "Such' said Sir Boss Smith "is not an idle fan tastic dream, but is at the present mo ment within the range of possibility. The powerfulness and durability of the machine is of ten"lost sight of and people are prone to imagine we have done only a freak exploit. That is not so. The machine at Mascot today is as good as when it left London and I would willingly start on a return journey to-morrow in it. All that is wanted to make the venture a. success is enterprise, organisation and capital" In reply to a question, Sir Rorn Smith said, with emphasis, "There is no truth in the statement that I am about to enter on a round-the-world fght, it is only cock and bull story and I want it dened at once.
