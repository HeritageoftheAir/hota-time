 TO-DAY'S Ctimiii. EXCITED WHEAT iliiARKETS. SYDNEY, LONDON, &) CHICAGO. Private cables to Sydney indicate that the tirisk ness of the Chicago and New York wheat markets is being reflected at Mark Lane- - London «peafed on Thursday morning with another rise o£-'3d plr quarter in the offers for Australian cargoes, Jurie luiir Bhinment: and an extra. 3d 'was nut on. at mid day in London, making an advance of €d on the cay, and of Is witiiin 4S hpUTE. ...'??? A- 353 6d per quarter is how. offering in London, for. forward Australian -cargoes, and the price in January was 29s, the advance on the five inonths is the substantial one of 934d a bushel. '. -, ? Business opened in Sydney with a few small sales of f.a.q. at 3s 10%d a tushei; out,, by 10 a-m.. :;s :iu was paid with fair' freedom', and' at noon. moEL holders asked 4s. '? .' . -- PRICE OP BREAD. If the rise in flour in Sydney is maintained, .the Sydney, suburban, and inland bakers will raise the retail price of the -2Ib loaf by a halfpenny. This advance has already beeii matte. In a tew of the country districts of New South 'Wales, and ;n several towns in New Zealand. FI/OUR ON THE VP GRADE. ? Should the range of f.a.q. wheat steady at 3s lld_to 4s a bushel (Sydney), the leading brands of city roller flour will be raised 5s or so per ton.. Best flour from ordinary wheats is about 2s Cd higher on the week. Manitoba flour,, made from New South Wales-grown wheat, is 5s to 10s higher, with good sale. Imported Canadian flour,' PillS hurj-'s Best (duty paid), has risen to £11 IDs a ton (Sydney). CHICKWHEAT DEARER. In sympathy with the rise in., f.a.q. wheat,,. the range for fowls' -feed has advanced, second milling samples realising 2s 9d a bushel (Sydney) in small lots. ? . FODDER FIRM. ' Tlie prevalence of harsh westerlies has stimulated inquiries from many parts of the country districts for lucerne and kindred lines. MAIZE WEAKER. Site welgtit of supplies of northern river maize on Bytlner wharf, and of Queensland maize at the rail-, iray, has resulted in lower quotations. BUTTER EXPORTS. : TJie Aberdeen liner Marathon leaves Sydney to morrow on her way to South Africa arid England, with 4000 boxes of New South Wales butter. The P.. M.S. Mongolia leaves Sydney to-morrow with 380 boxes of Kvir South Wales butter for London. SCARCITY OP APPLES. Adv.ces from Tasmania state that apples are . scarce there, and dear. This news will be a surprise to many in the Sydney, fruit trade, and will harden the values of choice New South Wales lines, both table and cooking. — ' Choice Victorian pears are ' in limited supply, and Sydney prices are firm. New South Wales navel oranges are worth up to Ss a gincase, and' the demand for navels is stimulated! by the indifferent quality at this time of year of a large.~percentage.Jof the common oranges. Many of the. Emperor -mandarines on offer are a bit on the green side. A -few bring 5s a gin rase. Choice Thornies are worth Ss 6d a -half-case. Lemons are rather cheap from the Cumberland or c.ho'c'iStE' point .of view, the demand having lessened because of the cooler weather. RAINS IN RIVERINA. -.u' cci respondent telegraphed this morning: — The recr-.-'.t rain? have vastly Unproved the outlook, both from a pastoral and agricultural point of view. The pc^ticri of the pastoral industry was becoming very Ferkiue, and hand-feeding was general. Since ihe rain the- grass has commenced to shoot, and sheep are iurri:;y from artificial feed to the natural grass. The arvf.rfal feed will be fed to larger stock. The breaking up of new land is now possible. To par ch;^*! t of recently-subdivided, areas it is most wel come as -their outlook * was gloomy. Had the rain held oil fcr another week or ten days, it meant Uie lots oia season to them. Sown areas are .shooting. Some lacdowners express the opinion that, though' the. area under cultivation will not approach,. last sea tiitis figures, next summer's harvest should .. be «ac ci^tioisaWy good, especially as regards the absence of v.-i_c-cv in the crops. -.-..?
