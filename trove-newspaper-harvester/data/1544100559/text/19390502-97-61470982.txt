 LONpON^-SYDNEY. Three Day 'Plane Service. Sir Donald Banks, Permanent Under-Secretary for Air in Great Britain and one of the three members of the British Air Mission to Austra lia, said in Melbourne last week, that aeroplanes able to cover the distance between London and Bydney in three days were now being built in Eng land. They were landplanes capable of a speed of 250 miles an hour, with a range of 2000 miles. . On such a service, he continued, the 'planeB would have to fly day and night and make only six calls during the trip, for refuelling. Thev would be blK enough to accommodate 12 pas sengers day and night and mail. It was not intended that this ser vice should supersede tbe exulting fly ing boat service, which was both com fortable and popular. Tbe new ser vice would be used and recognised en tirely as a special express for pas sengers and mail. Because of lack of 'planes it would not be possible, when service was Inaugurated to maintain a regular service to a strict schedule. The type of 'plane to be used would have Its first tests over the Atlantic from Croydan (England) to America in about in year's time. It was sug gested thabthe 'planes will be ready for the Australian service In 1942. Sir Donald Banks, who was accom panied by Lady Banks, left for Eng land In the Orford. He said that Australia had made more than satis factory progress in all channels of Civil aviation.
