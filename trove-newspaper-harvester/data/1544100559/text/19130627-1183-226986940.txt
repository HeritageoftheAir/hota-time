 LONDON TO SYDNEY: 21 DAYS. Ouo of tho priucipal objections to the journey from Eastern Australia to V: London is tho slow pace at which it is accomplished, and tho consequent. waste of vaiuablo timo on tho water— " , , n consideration which deters thou- ' /eands of us from making that ac quaintance with tho Motherland which Is tho ambition of almost every Aus- tralinn. The idoa of utilising the transcontinental railway to subytaiiU- 1 ally rcduco the period is almost within \ (right, but not until the long and weari- soma coastal tour round tho southora ports has glvon way to a quick and comfortablo journey by express can tho traveller look for an amelioration of the prcsont conditions. With mails, however, prospocts aro brighter, aud it is not too rash to predict that within a couplo of years letters from London 'will bo delivered in Dubbo within 22 days of duto of postage— a reduction of almost 30 per cent, on tho timo re quired at prcsont, for contracts haro already been lot for the commencement of important railway constructional work which is to connect Blaeksod, in Ireland, with the already existing Unco of cross-country railway. Conor- ally speaking, tho main idea is to util ise tho Canadian routo in preference to tho Red Sea, aud by tho construc tion of a now typo of steamship of a mall, but finely lined design, to to- 'duco the timo between London aud Winnipeg to fivo days, tho time-table of tho mails would then bo: London to Blacksod, ono dayj Blacksod to Capo St. Ohartaii Labrador, by means of the now steamers, three days; Capo St. Oharles to Winnipeg, by air-lino, 39 hours; and Winnipeg to tho Cana dian wostcrn coast, and theuco across the Pacific to Sydney, 14 days. Tho scheme, as will bo gathered, is no mere proposal it has behind it tho combined resourcoa of practically tho whole of tho Empire, aud, no has boon pointed out, work has already been begun. Tho social and economic benefits which accrue in Australia will bo in calculable.
