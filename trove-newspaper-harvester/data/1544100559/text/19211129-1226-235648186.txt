 LONDON TO-DAY — — u FILLED WITH FOREIGNERS. EX-SOLDIERS WITHOUT WORK- SYDNEY, Monday. Mr. J. D. Fitzgejrald, M.L.C., who has returned to Sydney after a seven months' tour of the world, says : "Dondon. is in a deplorable condition. There are" swarms of foreigners, in cluding Germans, who are percolating it in flocks. Worse still, the place is full of Russians. The leading Dondon hotels have nearly all foreign em ployees, while hundreds of ex- soldiers, wearing medals for bravery, are turn ing barrel organs in the streets. The organs are inscribed, drawing atten tion to: the fact of their services and the unfilled promises made to them. . "The terrible contrast between ex!- treme wealth and extreme poverty is ther© still. It is a sad sight to s?ee a hundred thousand unemployed parad ing the streets to attract the attention of their % fellow- citizens . "
