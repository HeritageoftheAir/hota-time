 THREE DAYS London to Darwin Pilot's Estimate ADELAIDE, Wednesday. "Judging by the types of machines competing in the Centenary air race, the winner of the open event would probably take three days from Lon don to Darwin, arriving at Melbourne on the fourth day," said Mr. H. F. Broadbent, Australian aviator, who is travelling to Sydney on the Karoola, which was at Port Adelaide to-day. The restrictive conditions imposed on aircraft entered for the Melbourne Centenary air race. which had de barred many of the American flyers from entering, suggested that Amerl can competition was feared, and also had created a bad impression abroad, he said. Mr. Broadbent. whose round-Aus tralia record was recently lowered by Mr. James Melrose, the Adelaide pilot. returned from England by the Oron say last week, but broke his voyage at Fremantle. The restrictions imposed on the Centenary air race entrants were par ticularly hard on the Americans, who had had to withdraw many of the fast American machines. If no re strictions had been placed on the types of machines competing, a number of fast American and Continental machines now debarred would have entered, enlarging the field and ad ding interest to the event. He said the reason he had withdrawn from the handicap race was that the prizes were not big enough to war rant the purchase of the necessary ex pensive machine. As Lloyds would not insure the 'planes, a private competi tor had to risk the loss of a machine worth £1500 for the chance of win ning £1750.
