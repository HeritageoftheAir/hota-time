 TO DARWIN- IN 7 DAYS Italian Flier to Honor Hinkier READY TO START ("News" Special Representative) LONDON, April 3. Capt. Leonida Robbiano, described as the most handsome man in the Italian Air Force, plans to start for Darwin on Friday. His plane has a cruising range of 2,700 miles. and he hopes by flying day and night to reach Australia in seven days. Capt. Robbiano was stopped by unfavor able weather from hopping off on March 14, and he decided to wait for the next moon. He went back to Italy, but returned to London a few days ago. He will drop a wreath in honor of Mr. Bert HIinkler over the Grecian Archi pelago on the eastern Mediterranean, because Italian airmen now believe that Hinkler crashed there at the end of his first long hop on January 7, when he left England for Australia. Capt. Robbiano will also fly to Bunda berg, Queensland, when he reaches Aus tralia, to see Hinkler's mother. INTERESTED IN AIR RAQE Capt. Robbiano said Italians were in terested in the proposed international race to Australia, and were awaiting the con ditions of Sir Macpherson Robertson's fine sporting offer of a Â£10.000 prize. Foreigners specially appreciate the rac" being open to the world, he said. It shows that the British are ready to com pete with any pilots and planes. But he thought the race should be a handicap event similar to the King's Cup, in Bri tain, which would give a chance to all planes instead of only to the fastest.
