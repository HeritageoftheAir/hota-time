The Idea simply Is that as time goes on, the day lengthens to 23 hours, to 26 hours, and so on, until the period at present repre senting two days will be comprised in one. And. of course, the theory goes much further than that, and it will take pos sibly millions of years to work out. At i present, the earth rotates thirty times In I a month, thirty-one time. in' the longer I months, and the professor's statement j about rotating eighteen times represents the period when the length of the day of- now shall be nearly doubled.
