 IN 15 DAYS. DARWIN TO LONDON. AERIAL MAIL PLAN. (Australian Press Association.) LONDON, November 17. Representatives of the Royal Dutch Air Line that is operating a fortnightly mail service between Amsterdam and Sourabaya, have interviewed Mr. Scullin (Australian Prime Minister), ' with a view to opening negotiations for an ex- tension of the service to Darwin on a subsidy basis. The question is too large to permit of definite proposals being advanced at this stage, but the aviation authorities are going into the details. The Royal Dutch Air Line at present undertakes to deliver letters from the Dutch East Indies in London in 11 days, so, if the necessary guarantees regarding the efficiency of the service are forthcoming, they could probably connect Darwin and London by letter in 15 days. The rate probably would be between 2/ and 2/6 per half ounce. Moreover the airline probably will in- stitute a weekly service if the subsidy is granted. At least three Australian services are likely to benefit-National Airways, Qantas, and Larkin Aircraft, but the subsidy that is now paid to the West Australian Airways for the Perth Adelaide service is one of the many difficulties confronting the proposition. If the flying Dutchmen undertake the service most of the overseas air mails will enter and leave Australia through the North, consequently the West Aus- tralian subsidy would be largely wasted. It seems as though the comparatively slow development of British commer- cial airlines overseas is likely to allow their foreign rival to bridge this im- portant Imperial link.
