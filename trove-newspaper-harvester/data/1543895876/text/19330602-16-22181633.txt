 IN U DAYS. Berlin to Darwin. DISCUSSION OF PLANS. LONDON, May 31. Plans are being discussed for the naval airman, Lieutenant Owen Cath cart-Jones, to attempt a record flight from Berlin to Darwin in three and a half days. He proposes to use a Ger- man Heinkel monoplane, fitted with a withdrawable undercarriage. A piquant touch of mystery is .given by the an- nouncement that a young English- woman, whose name is not stated, will act as reserve pilot. [Lieut. Cathcart-Jones was formerly personal pilot to the late Lieut. Com- mander Glen Kidston, with whom, in 1931, he made the then record flight from London to Capetown in 6 days 11 hours. He also held the record of 72 minutes for the flight from London to Paris.l
