 NEW AIR RECORD DARWIN TO LONDON BY CHARLES MELROSE Flight Takes 8 Days 9 Hours LONDON, Sept. 28. Mr. Charles J. Melrose, the young South Australian entrant in the London-Mel- bourne air race, who left Darwin for England in a D.H. Gipsy Moth 'plane on September 20, landed at Croydon at 7 a.m. to-day, having flown from Australia in 8 days 9 hours, breaking the record by three hours. The aeroplane came droning out of the blue and landed at Croydon almost un- noticed. A young man climbed out and announced himself as Charles James Mel- rose, of Glenelg, South Australia.

The possibility of his breaking the record was not realised until a message was published that he left Lyons at 2.30 a.m. to-day. In an interview, Melrose said that until he reached Calcutta he did not intend to try to break the record, but seeing the times he made, he then decided to sacri- fice some sleep and go "all out" for Croy- don. The flight was entirely without inci- dent, except that one landing-place was covered to a depth of two feet with water. The engine of the plane gave not the slightest trouble. "I started from Australia with £10," he said, "and I have £3 left. Of course that does not include petrol, for which I still have to pay. Even then it was cheaper than a first-class steamer fare. I think I have made a record, but the times must be converted from local to British summer- time before I can say definitely."
