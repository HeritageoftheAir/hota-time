Butler, the Australian airman, established a new record for a flight from England to Australia. His time (after allowing for the difference of 9J hours Letween Greenwich and Darwin tunes) :was 9 days 1 hour 40 minutes, which is .1 hour 45 minutes less than that taken t-y Mr. C. W. A. Scott when he broke Air-Commodore Kingsford Smith's record ilast April. ' -Butler left Lympne (England) at 5.10 ia jn. on October 31, and the journey soon became a dramatic race 'against Scotfs ichedule. Reaching India in record time (3 days 22J hours to Karachi), Butler ' secured, a lead of a few hours, but lost it an Burma. After a battle against head winds, he was able to Tegain an advantage ?'sufficient to enable him barely to break ?Scottfe record, the difference between the times for the two flights, each half way around- the world, made with different machines and under different conditions, being under two hours. - Cheers from a large crowd greeted But ler when he landed at the Darwin aero drome, where;. he was^ 'welcomed by the 3Iayor .(Mr. .Brown). His first question was: 'Did I beat Scott?'' and his next ^whether .he could jserid. his mother a tele gram . telling her 'he -had arrived safely.
