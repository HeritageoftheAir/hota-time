Brook's record light aero plane solo flight from Australia to England won pride of place in Lon don newspapers to-day. Only a small group of aviation en thusiasts were present at Lympne when the little red aeroplane dropped out Df the sky, and they heartily cheered Brook when he landed. Unlike the hero he was, Brook climbed out of his machine, adjusted his spectacles, and asked for a cup of tea. Brook told a throng of repor ters that his flight had been uneventful, and that there was nothing worth talking about, ex cept the spot of bother he had when crossing the Timor Sea. A congratula tory telegram from Sir Mac nhersnn Rohprt. H. h. Brook H. h. Brook son afforded Brook much delight. The Leeds Aviation Club has plan ned an aerial welcome for Brook to morrow, and he will afterwards be accorded a civic reception at Harro gate.
