 AT DARWIN TODAY? 11 Days From London If Kingsford Smith reaches Darwin this afternoon, he will have added a notable commercial flight to his long list of avia tion achievements. He will then have accomplished the trip from England to Australia in 111 days. Smith left Batavia at 6 a.m. yesterday. His plans then were to make Koepang before dark, and complete the last hop to Australia (475 miles) today. The north-west monsoonal winds will be more of a help than a hindrance to "Smithy," but this is a time of year when he might unexpectedly meet local thunderstorms or thick clouds. Tropical downpours are also likely at this time off the Australian coast. The flight from England began from Hamble at 8 a.m. on January 7.
