Adams, and takes his place In. all respects as one of the ordinary students. . The Count Davilier writes from Chisei hurst to say that oh no occasion whatever did the -Emperor 'Napoleon ever declare that he would only return to Paris from the German campaign ' dead or victo rious.' This ' presumptuous language' was never used by the Emperor ' in his proclamations, in his speeches, nor in his private conversations. ' Several Cabinet Councils have been held during the past fortnight. Lord Belmore will -shortly resign the government of New South Wales, and will be succeeded in that office by Sir Hercules Robinson, K.C.M.G., the pre sent Governor of Ceylon. Lord Dufferin has been created Earl of Dufferin-in the county of Down. Mr. Childers will shortly return to England, his health being completely re established. The right ion. gentleman Is now in Berlin. The distinction of the Legion of Honor has been presented to Mr. George Moore, Colonel Stuart Wortley, and Mr. Alfred de Rothschild by the French Government for the services rendered by them in con nection with the Mansion House Com mittee in revictualling Paris after the siege had been raised. Letters received in Birmingham from Mr. Bright give an encouraging account of the state of the right hon. gentleman's health. It is not, however, considered probable that Mr. Bright will address his constituents this winter. Mr. Gladstone addressed his consti tuents at Grenwich, on Blackheath, on Saturday last. From 10,000 to 15,000 persons were present. His speech was an able vindication of his three years government. A vote of confidence was almost unanimously passed. Mr. Bennett, the watchmaker of Cheap side, has been chosen one of the Sheriffs of London in succession to Mr. Young, deceased. Great discussion has taken place during the month relative to an alleged alliance between the Conservative chiefs and the Artisan leaders for promoting social reforms. ? Both sides seem to have been duped by Mr. Scott Russell. The Church Congress has been held at Nottingham, under the presidency of the Bishop of Lincoln. The Autumnal Session of the Congre gational Union was held at Swansea, the Rev. Thos. Jones presiding. The Social Science Congress was held at Leeds, Sir John Pakington in the chair. At a National Education League Con ference at Birmingham, it was resolved to bring in a Bill next session to amend the Education Act, especially the 25th clause. The London School Board has been for more than a week discussing its by-laws. The compulsory principle was affirmed, aud the proposal to pay the fees of indi gent children in denominational schools was withdrawn. Each case is to be dealt with separately. This is a heavy blow to the Education Department, which has urged the payment of fees generally on school boards. Earl Granville has. been speaking from the chair at a Meeting of Manchester Radicals, the occasion being ? the inaugu ration of a new Reform Club building for that city. In respect to the ballot, he expressed a hope that the House of Lords would not, like the House of Commons, be found long to resist a measure which he had not the slightest doubt it was the wish of the country to pass. (Loud cheers.) He proceeded to advert to the 'New Social Movement' which is, just now, the sub ject of so many disclosures, and he then passed to foreign politics, taking special credit for the Washington treaty. The Secretary of the Treasury and Go vernment ' whipper-in,' Mr. G. C. Glyn, has been malting a speech at Shaftesbury defending Government on the army, ballot, |and financial questions, and taking credit to them for having done 'justice to Irelaud ('No, no'), passed the Education Bill, -fec. -:The Birmingham Conference on the reform of the House of Lords, originally intended to be held in November, is now definitely fixed for the 6th of December, in order to avoid interference with other local events. Mr. Ryland, M.P., in addressing his constituents at Warrington, expressed his confident belief that next year the Government would be able to reduce the expenditure by 'some millions.' At a recent . meeting of the English Synod of the United Presbytery in London, a resolution approving of an immediate union with the English Pres byterian Church in England was passed by a majority of ten. The General Svnod. which meets next Mav. is to be asked to advise what steps Bhould be taken. :The foundation-stone of the college for the daughters of ministers has been laid at Grave'send, by Mr. S. Morley, M.P. The question .of completing the building for 150 pupils is under consideration. A guild of ladiesiBproposedtobeformed to promote modesty of dress, to d'o away with extravagance, . and substitute the neatness.and sobriety suitable to Chris tian women. Miss Harrison; of Swanage, Dorset, is acting as organiser of the guild. . .'' .''?'?? It is now stated that the Mordaunt divorce case will be tried over again, and that the former ? witnesses have been subpoenaed. The Tichbornecase is to be resumed on the 7th of November, and a, statement is made that Arthur Orton will be the first witness called. — The -enquiry into— the— stranding of the jTJnderley off the Isle of Wight has been brought to a close. The judgment of the Court was that the Underley was stranded through the absence of due care on the part of Mr. Spurgeon, the .pilot, .yet as' the law did not relieve the master from his re sponsibility in improperly leaving the ship iin the sole 'charge 'of a person 'whose compulsory duties' had 'ceased, the court pronounced Captain Tidmarshin default. BeaiiEg in mind-, ;however, the high chariicter he had hitherto borne, they thou »ht a suspension of his certificate, for three calendar months would meet the justice of the case. ?The Lord Mayor presided on Wednes day iat a meeting held at the Mansion Houke for the purpose of setting on foot a subscription f or'the relief Jof -the famine in Persia. A Committee was appointed to manage the fund. Three years of drought has well-nigh depopulated the sparsely-covered and ill-governed empire — once so splendid — which now i occupies . so small a space in the world's regard or interest. Thou sands are dying in the streets of Ispahan, and the wandering tribes which form so large a part of the population are suffer ing even more severely from want of food than the dwellers in the towns. Many of the French Communists are nowj in London. No fewer than 70 of them are -dependent on the bounty of friends, or on the chance contributions of benevolent strangers. The warrant under .. the Royal Sign Manual, which prescribes the rules under which promotion by merit shall supersede the system of purchase in the army, has appeared in the Gazette. The dash of the jpen which revolutionises our mili tary methods was made 'at our Court at Balmoral, this 30th of October,' and the commands of the English army are no longer mere amuse ments for the wealthy, but objects of competition for the hard-forking and the clever. As might be expected, officers have sent in their papers ' by hundreds and hundreds. ' In one cavalry regiment one major and six captains and several subalterns seek to retire. An address, signed by 10,000 women, was 'presented to the Council of the Uni versity of Edinburgh, asking that such arrangements should be made as will afford women the means of obtaining a complete medical education, and of tak ing medical degrees from the University. By 107 to 97 the Council refused the prayer of the petition. xne scneme ior tne amalgamation or the Lancashire and Yorkshire with the London and North Western Railway Company has been adopted at special meetings of the shareholders of both Companies. The great strike of engineers at New castle ended a fortnight ago by a com promise ; but the nine hours' demand was conceded, and the arrangement is now general in the north. There have been many strikes in various departments of labor throughout the country, the workmen being generally successful. A large number of Lanca shire firms, owing to the low prices now received for manufactured goods, had resolved to work the mills on short time for the next four weeks. The Government decline to release any more. Fenian prisoners, they having been guilty of murder and outrage, and not of political crimes. The Irish Catholic Bishops have pub lished resolutions requiring that denomi national education and separate revision of education shall be established in Ire land in order to satisfy the Catholics. . The trial of Kelly, alias Pemberton, for the murder of Head-Constable Talbot, was commenced on Monday, in theCourt ?house, Dublin, and is not yet over. Im mence difficulty was found in getting a Jury. Great mobs have filled the streets, and a large military force guards the pri soner and the Court. The defence (con ducted by Mr. Butt, M. P.) seeks to show that the surgical treatment to which Talbot had been subjected was not pro per, and that it had at least accellerated, if not contributed to his death. It is thought that the Jury fearing popular fury will not agree in. their verdict. On the 18th, the Lord Mayor of Lon don gave a banquet to M. Leon Say, Prefect of the Seine ; M. Vautrain, Pre sident of the Municipal Council of Paris ; and several other French gentlemen who have visited London to thank the inhabitants for the timely assistance rendered to Paris after the late siege. A large and distinguished company was present. Next day these dis tinguished^ Frenchmen offered, on the part of the City of Paris for the accept ance of London, a gold medal and a mag nificent model in bronze of the Hotel de Ville before its destruction ; and. M. Say then read an address, agreed to by the Municipal Council of Paris, tTnuiirinor the Corporation for the kindness which they had shown to Paris in her distress. M. Vautrain also briefly addressed the Court. The ex-Emperor was interviewed at Chislehurst on Sunday, and the sub stance of his remarks was given by authority in the Times. The gist of his observation is that he resolutely dis courages all intrigues and plots on behalf of his dynasty, holding as 'most culpable' any persons who should seek to foment trouble for the -advancement of their personal interests at a time when France needs repose. He relies upon a ' moral reaction ' in favor of the Empire, but to attempt to overthrow the present regim/e would be a ' bad action.' At the same time Napoleon IH. regards his rights as still intact, ' and so long as the people shall not have been regularly consulted, no decision of the Chamber can prevent me from being the legitimate Sovereign of France.' But why should France be required to express her decision only by means of a plebiscite, -which is simply a cunning Napoleonic invention ? The ex Emperor is far more damaged by the new disclosures of Prince Bismarck relative to Ms designs on Belgium, which have been published at Berlin in reply to Count Benedetti, than by the intrigues of his partisans in France.
