This is the best BUitish machine yet definitely announced as entering the rate, and has enhanced British prospects. It is understood that the buildes of Avros have prcpared plans of a machine of approximately equivalent capabilities, in view of the race. Although it has not yet finally been decided to enter, it is now more likely that a Boulton and Paul mail carrier plane will be a starter. "My machine was not originally deeirned for the race, but 1 thought that it would be ideally suitable," said Capt. Stack. "A modification in design will be neces sary, also special engines. Although it would not be as speedy as some of the German and American planes rumored to be entering, It would have a good chance. LEISURELY FLIGHT "I will have a co-pilot and engineer and fly day and night, with the objective of reaching Darwin in three and a half daye. Before the race we hope to fly leisurely to Australia, exploring the route. Already I know it as far ns Calcutta thoroughly." [Capt. Stack has made some remark able flights.
