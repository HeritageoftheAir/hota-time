 BERLIN-DARWIN IN 3i DAYS ? LONDON, Wednesday. Plans are being discussed for the naval airman, Lieut enant Cathcart Jones, to attempt a record flight from Berlin to Darwin in three and a half days in a German Heinkel monoplane, fitted with a withdrawable under carriage. A piquant touch of mystery is given to the announcement by the statement that a young unnamed English woman will act as reserve pilot.
