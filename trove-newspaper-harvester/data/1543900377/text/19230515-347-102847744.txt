 -WONDERFUL AIRCRAFT MELBOURNE TO LONDON IN 20 HOURS. - It would sound foolish if you heard tt on-the Block (says the Melbourne '-Herald'*); But is it? If the'claims advanced by the'inventor and designer, a Scottish engineer, are substantiated, there will shortly be a flying machine which will force 'us to revise all our ideas' - The craft, which is toeing considered by the British Air Ministry, Is >cap able of carrying a . thousand passen gers on s non-stop flight of 1800 miles at the' unprecedented speed of 600 miles* an- hour-^more than twice "the highest speed, yet attained by a rac ing aeroplane."-:The airship is 450 fe_et in lei\?th; and has. a beam and depth of 40 .feet.c-while its -construction is metallic throughout. The operating, costs have;-been estimated at a half penny -per ^passenger mile. Passengers - will thus be able to board the vessel in Melbourne at -two o'clock in 'the morning and, allowing for "half-hour stops at, say, Perth, Singapore, Colombo, Aden and Malta, arrive in London at eleven o'clock at night on the same day! This at a' cost of £23 ifor-.the trip. Imagine meeting a, friend on the Block one afternoon and, learning that he-or she-was leaving for London by-the. night mail, making an i appointment for ;ths Alhambra the fol lowing .night,- with Murray's or the Piccadilly for supper afterwards! Strange as it may seem, we shall be doing that very soon. The speed of aircraft has been increasing Iby leaps snd bounds in the past decade, and there is no halt being called. The coming-decade will witness even mnr«? wonderful achievements, and what is considered impossible to-day will not 1 raisft the mildest thrill ten years hence.
