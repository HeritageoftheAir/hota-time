 TAKE 58 HOURS. FLIGHT TO MELBOURNE. Fitzmaurice's Intentions. LONDON, October 24. Leaving Lympno aerodrome at 3 a.m. on Saturday, Col. Fitzmaurice, in the Bellanca 'plane, plans to reach Melbourne in 68 hours, hoping thus to break Scott's record by 11 hours. Col. Fitzmaurice proposes to stop an hour at Baghdad, Allahabad, Singapore, and Darwin, and to touch down his wheels at Charleville. He will change his spark plugs at Alla habad. He expects to make two moonlight landings. LANDING TESTS. It was reported here that Colonel Fitzmaurice (Ireland) had success fully carried out a landing test with a load of 83501b., and that the Ame rican officials who were present granted a certificate. Later, however, London represen tatives of the authorities concerned with the test advised that they had issued an incorrect report, due to the optimistic message receivel when the machine landed at Portsmouth from Croydon. An official test was not un dertaken owing to the absence of a weighing instrument, which Fitzmau rice hopes to secure this afternoon. BERLIN COMMENT. BERLIN, October 24. No paper except "AngritY" criti cises the disqualification of Colonel Fitzmaurice. "Tageblatt" explains the case fully and fairly, also pays a tribute to the Dutchmen's achieve ment as being equal if not greater than that of the special race 'plane.
