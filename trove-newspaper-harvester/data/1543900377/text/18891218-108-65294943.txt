 EU OIPEAN TELEGRAMS. [MELBOURNE PAPEIL.] THE EIGHT HOURS SYSTEMI. S. Lu oN, Dec. 10. Strong efforts are being made by the pro. moters of the measure which it is proposed to introduce into the British Parliament this session to legalise the eight hours labor system throughout England.r Mr W. L. Gladstone, who has been asked to introduce the bill in the House of Com mons, iha written to the promoters of the movement stating that physical infirmity %ill prevent him initiating the measure, and expressing hli intention of considering its details lairly, fully, and without prejudice when the bill is brouglt down. Lord Ranidolph Churchill has expressed the opinion that the eight hours system is an ideal scheme, which he believes will have the effect of diminishing tihe unemployed trouble oi England, that the comfort which the masses will enjoy under such a system ivill more than compensate the employers tor the loss which they will at first ap. parently sustain, and that the fear of com. petition in trade from other countries where cheap labor prevails, is a mere bogus that will not stand tie test of practical investiga tion. Lord Randolph Churchill is of opinion that Europe and America will quickly follow in the wake of England and Australia in establihing the eight hours system as the law of the land, bat Ihe considers that the ore'essential to the universal success of the scheme will be the absolute exclusion of all piuper lal.or from Engldnd.
