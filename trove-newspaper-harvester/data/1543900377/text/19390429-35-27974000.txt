 HUGE AIRLINERS To London in 1 0 Hours. PILOTS PREDICTION. ' MELBOURNE, Friday. Captain J. Francis, a senior pilot of Australian National Airways Pty., Ltd., In an address last night, predicted that in 10 years huge airliners would fly through the stratosphere from Melbourne to London in 10 hours, carry- ing between 200 and 300 passengers. Already designs had been prepared in the United States ior airliners capable of carrying 100 passengers at a speed o√≠. more than 200 miles an hour non-stop for - 5,000 miles. Captain Francis said. Up to this limit, land machines would be. abie to use standard airports; but when they became larger, this was not possible. Thus flying-boats able to land in inlets and harbours were. necessary for the carriage of 200 or 300 passengers. The huge machines would travel in tho stratosphere at speeds up to 000. miles en hour. They would,make the entire journey in bright sunshine above nil storms and wind. Captain Francis added that new types of altimeters, which gave tho height above the nearest land instead of height above sea level, would be installed in Australian airliners in about four months.
