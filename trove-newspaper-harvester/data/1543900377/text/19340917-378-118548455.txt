 PENNY'S CHANCE. BRITISH RACE ENTRANT. Melbourne in 60 Hours. LONDON, September 15. "Between now and October 20, I'll spend most of my time seeking an ex pert co-pilot and navigator, also train to fit my 75 inches Into the small cockpit. I am praying that the 'plane will arrive from America in time," said H. W. Penny, a British air race entrant. Yes terday he told a Press re presentative that he expected the 'plane a week before the race, but it would be a touch and go. "I am not taking Downes, an ex-R.AA.F.P pilot from Melbourne, who accompanied me to the United States, and I am aban doning the idea of a crew of four as I want a range of 8000 miles." said, Mr. Penny. For the past month he was in the United states superintending the con struction of his 'plane, and sight seeing. He believes that Cochrane's crew has the best chance among the American contestants, as he had money to burn, and was burning it in elaborately organising ground staffts on route. Pilot Wesley Smith is a "do or die" type of flier, said Mr. Penny, who said he had not touched alcohol for six weeks, He was regularly exercising In a gymnasium, and staying awake for 48 hours. He plans to undertake long motor drives in a cramped car to accustom his muscles for the flight. "After working on my 'plane at Los Angeles, I expect to get 245 miles an hour out of her, and to arrive in Melbourne in 60 hours after the start," said Mr. Penny, on landing at Plymouth. His 'plane will arrive at the end of September. NO WITHDRAWAL FROM POST. In view of the American report that Wiley Post is abandoning the centenary race because he damaged the Winnie Mae during a test flight Into the stratosphere, Mr. Perrin (Secretary of the Royal Aero Club) said he has not received Wiley Post's withdrawal, nor any advylce of the ac cident.
