 London to Melbourne in 58 Hours ATTEMPT THIS WEEK. One of the most daring aer- ial dashes in the annals of fly- ing—London to Melbourne in 58 hours — is planned by the famous Irish Free State air- man, Colonel J. C. Fitzmaur- ice, in his Bellanca low-winged monoplane, which was spec- ially designed for the Mac- Robertson air race. Fitzmaurice, who withdrew from the air race after being called upon to make a big re- duction in the weight of his machine, proposed to leave Lympne Aerodrome yesterday morning. He will be accom- panied by P. W. Bonar, the well-known American aviator.
