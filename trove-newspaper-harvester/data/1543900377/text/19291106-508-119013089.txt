 197 HOURS LONDON : MELBOURNE BRITISH HOPES &nbsp; LONDON, Tuesday. At conference in London to-day &nbsp; the Master of Sempill produced tabular statistics to show that, by improved ground conditions, the utilisation of night flying, and other modern developments, the present flying time between London and Melbourne, 17 days, could be reduc- ed in the near future to 179 hours. The conference was organised by Sir Alan Cobham, to discuss the necessity of municipal airports. The Master of Sempill, who is presi- dent of the Royal Aeronautical Society, referred appreciatively to Australian de- velopment of civil aviation. Australia's subsidy of £80,000 was more than com- pared, on a population basis, with Brit- ain's £345,000. Moreover, the whole Empire subsidies, including this, amount- ed only to £442,000. Canada preferred to give generous air-mail postal contracts.
