The February wool sales opened yesterday. There was a large attendance of buyers ; but the competition for the several parcels cata logued was not spirited, and buyers held back. Sydney wools were sold at the closing rates of last season ; and pricts may, therefore, be said to remain unchanged The Port Phillip wools submitted to the hammer experienced a decline, and prices realised for scoured fine -were l£d lower than revious rates. For the South Australian wool catalogued, biddings were also slack; and, scoured fine may also be said to be l£d lower in their case. Tin.— Block £145 per ton. Market steady with an upward tendency. Copp£b.-!-£93 per ton, being a fall of £1 on previous quotations. In consequence of the strikes in Wales, coals are still rising. They have' increased three shillings per ton within the past few, days. Hartley's are now quoted at 36s. The result of this state of things is, that manufacturers find themselves unable to com plete orders, and .in many branches, of trade are closing their works. '
