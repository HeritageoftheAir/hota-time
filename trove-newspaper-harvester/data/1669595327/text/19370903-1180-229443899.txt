Details of the agreement between the Commonwealth and Dutch Gov ernments, under which the Royal Netherlands Indies Airways will ex tend its service to Australia, will, It is PVnprÂ»f/H hn nnnnnnpprf riovf. wPnlr Australia lias agreed In principle to the extension of the services from Batavia, but the terminal in the Com monwealth has not yet been revealed. It is probable that the planes will bo allowed to travel as far as Sydney, but that the carriage of mails and passengers between internal centres will be prohibited. This will virtually mean the appli cation of the Navigation Act regula tions, for the first time, to an air ser vice. A probable schedule of 6i days from London to Darwin will be main tained by the Dutch service. Douglas airliners will be used all the way. Negotiations which have been pro ceeding between the Governments for months, were chiefly concerned with the reciprocal rights. It is almost certain thnt Australian services will have the right to land at any Dutch East Indian aerodrome and to fly over Dutch territory. These rights are at present granted by the Dutch to Qantas Empire Air ways. and the Dutcli use British aerodromes when crossing India. The agreement will be particularly valuable to Australia when the Em pire flying-boat air mail service begins next year, in that bases in Dutch territory will be assured. Carriage of all mails will be re served to Empire services.
