 FOUR DAYS FLIGHT TO LONDON SYDNEY, Wednesday. The London-Sydney civil air service to open soon will occupy only 38 days air travel, said Mr. Hudson Fysh, managing director of QANTAS Airways, on his return from a trip to England. He revealed that the initial service to Australia would be flown with Lancastrians, a converted version of the Lancaster bomber. The inauguration of the England-Australia route was a most important link between the Empire and other countries, which he was confident would be carried out with a 100 per cent. British service and by British planes.
