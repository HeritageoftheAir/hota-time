 SYDNEY TO LONDON IN 4 DAYS j Prospects of Air Travel: The managing director of a London aircraft manufacturing company says that he is absolutely confident that within a reasonable time aeroplane trips between Melbourne and Jvonelon at a net speed of 100 miles an hour will be a regular institution. The journey between. London and Sydney will occupy four days. Across America. Four army aeroplanes from San Diego (California) have arrived in New York, having completed the first transcontinental flight. Repeated breakdowns occurred, and the journey occupied a month. 1 Within five years navigation in an aeroplane in bad weather ought to be as easy as steering a ship in similar circumstances," declared the president of the Air Council - (Lord Weir in a speech at Manchester a fortnight ago. "Already WE have aeroplanes which are able to climb 10,000ft., travel 100 miles an hour, make a non-stop journey of 1,200 miles, alight on the sea. and rise again with a full load. A new and tremendous industry is about to be created out of the Royal Air Force, which has been trained and developed in war, and will put L its lessons into practice for the purposes til (peace and civilisation. The Air Force, which had 285 officers and 1,853 men in August, 1914, now includes 30,000 officers and 260 000 men, besides 30,00 women and boys. The chief problems of the immediate future are severe iiavigational-itraininic,'- the creation of an energetic meteorological service, the adoption of improved wireless telegraphy and telephony, and the adoption of a first-class system of day and night mark a ing of landing places and aerodromes. These things will cost a lot of money, but they 1 will consummate and justify the work of the men who have died." Since this statement by Lord Weir a Handley-Page aeroplane, carrying an Australian officer as passenger, has flown from London to Calcutta.
