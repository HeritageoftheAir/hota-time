 MAUGHAN, K.C. FOR LONDON. Abolition Issue. SYDNEY, To-day. TtrR. DAVID MAUGHAN, K.C., will t*t> go to London at the year's end to assist in opposing the Lang Gov ernment's appeal to the Privy Council over the abolition of the Legislative Council. The appeal will be argued early in the new year. Mr. Maughan argued the case against the abolition in the State Full Court and High Court Australia. Not to see the promised land to wards which one has led others, or contributed , ever so little to leading others—this J.s the unchangeable law ■ of true life. ' The mofe genuine the ! work of-true life, the more remote, are 1 Its results; and not only Temote, but pndless.'are" its consequences: there fore, we. .cannot .see them. We can foresee more than our generation will witness. A house that is being built, we may see, and we may reach the rank of general; hut we. shall not witness liberation from State slavery, nor even from Land slavery; This is the most evident proof that life con sists, not in the realisation of an aim, i but in the-fulfilment of an-embassy.— Tolstoy."; r"' .
