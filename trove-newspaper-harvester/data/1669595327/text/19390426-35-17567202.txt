 THREE DAYS' FLIGHT. LONDON TO SYDNEY. Planes Now Being Built. MELBOURNE, Tuesday. Sir Donald Banks, Permanent Under- secretary for Air in Great Britain and one of the three members of the British Air Mission to Australia, said to-day that aeroplanes able to cover the dis- tance between London and Sydney in three days were now being built in England. They were landplanes capable of a speed of 250 miles an hour, with a range of 2,000 miles. On such a service, he continued, the planes would have to fly day and night and make only six calls during the trip, for refuelling. They, would be big enough to accommodate 12 passengers day and night, and mail. It was not intended that this service should supersede the existing flying-boat service, which was both comfortable and popular. The new service would be used and recog- nised entirely as a special express for pas- sengers and mail. Because of lack of planes, it would not be possible, when the service was inaugurated, to maintain a regular ser- vice to a strict schedule. The type of plane to be used would have its first tests over the Atlantic from Croy- don (England) to America in about a year's time. It was suggested that the planes will be ready for the Australian service in 1942. Sir Donald Banks, who was accompanied by Lady Banks, left for England in the Or- ford to-day. He said that Australia had made more than satisfactory progress in all channels of Civil aviation.
