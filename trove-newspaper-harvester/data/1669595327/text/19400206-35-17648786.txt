 From Day to Day in Sydney. London in Wartime. "'THE only casulty during the entire evacua- tion of school children from London was one small boy with a bleeding nose," said the Rev. Bernard Cockctt yesterday, when he spoke on "London in Wartime" at the first luncheon for the year of the Soroptomist Club at Farmer's. "The Sunday after war was declared the usual number of 400 chil- dren in my Sunday school had dwindled to three, and thirty-five teachers arrived to teach them. The children who evacuated to Bed- ford attended school In the afternoon, and the Bedford children attended in the morning. Some of the small girls who were billctted' at big mansions were behaving like perfect little aristocrats within a week." Overseas League Annual Meeting.
