 TO-DAY'S COMMEBCIAL; WHEAT INACTIVE. IN LONDON AND SYDNEY. The cabled sale of a cargo of South Australian wheat in London at 36s 6d per quarter repre sents 4s 6%d per bushel in London, which is equivalent to 3s S%d per bushel, f.o.b., Sydney, Melbourne, or Adelaide, without allowing for profit to the exporter. This shipment left Adelaide on January 21,' and is 38 days out. The price now realised in London, compared Tvith the value of wheat in Adelaide towards the close of January, shows a heavy loss to the shipper, assuming that the grain had not pre viously changed hands on the water. Wheat is about a halfpenny a bushel dearer in Sydney on the Press cables from London. . It is well, however, for the N.S.W. farmers to know that private cables are to hand, indicat- : ing that the improvement in London is for spot cargoes only, as the gales around the Eng lish coast had delayed some vessels and the in- . tjuinies in London for. distant cargoes are al-; most nil. One or two of the Australian ship pers are complaining that they cannot get an offer from London for 'futures.' It is said ' to be the opinion of some of the Argentine ; shippers that wheat will have a sharp fall in London by the first week in June. A strengthening factor of the Sydney wheat market is the fact that it suits some of the N-;w South Wales country millers better to ; give an extra penny or twopence a bushel for grain bought 'across country' from local grow ers than to draw on Sydney or Adelaide. ONIONS FOR AMERICA. Sydney is in receipt of buying orders for 50 to 100 tons of Victorian (Brown Spanish) onions, to be cased here for 'Frisco. Hence a further advance in Sydney to £5 a ton for extra prime* bulbs, this figure being only. on a par with the. Victorian quotations, with expenses added. ' Ht'NTER RIVER LUCERNE. \ The floods on the Hunter have temporarily stopped the arrival of large bales of lucerne at, Sydney wharf. BUTTER MORE PLENTIFUL. The good growth of herbage in the dairying districts along the South Coast is increasing the output of butter week by week, and any further drop in the London market would prob ably be quickly reflected in a lowering of the; Sydney wholesale quotations. Meantime, su-. perfine brands are selling well in Sydney, but seconds are hard to quit at full rates. SUSSEX-STREET QUOTATIONS.
