 CHEERS FOR THE SYDNEY "A Black flay for Germany" LONDON, Saturday. The Baltic Exchange, to the accom- paniment of loud cheers, to-day car- ried a resolution of thanks to the Allied navies, and particularly to H.M.A.S. Sydney, for destroying the German cruiser Emden. The newspapers compliment the telegraphists at Cocos Island on their alertness in despatching cable and wireless messages, giving warning of the arrival of the Emden. The "Cologne Gazette" says:â€”"Mon- day was a black day for Germany, when she lost two ships. Such an achievement on the sea in one day was beyond the dreams of Englishmen."
