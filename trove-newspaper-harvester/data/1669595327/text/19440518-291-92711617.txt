 LONDON TO SYDNEY UNDER FOUR DAYS Air Travel After War LONDON. May 10— AAP. In London on Friday night and in Sydney for breakfast on the fol- lowing Monday — that was the vision of the future of air travel as told by Lord Knollys, chairman of the British Overseas Airways Corporation, in a speech to the Royal Empire Society today. Lord Knollys gave this picture of a journey from London to Austra- lia and New Zealand:— 'On the Friday evening you will step into a large aircraft weighing over 50 tons— as roomy as a Pullman car. You will fly comfortably at 20.000 or 30.000 feet, above the bad wea- ther, cruising at between 230 and 250 m.p.h Next morning you will be awakened in your bunk with early morning tea to find yourself looking over the shores of the east- ern Mediterranean 'After breakfast you will be on your way to India, where you will arrive that same Saturday night. Then across India and on to Singa- pore and Australia, reaching Syd- ney on Monday morning in time to do your work, or on to New Zea- land six or seven hours later 'That journey will be for the man in a hurry, who will be able to do it without undue fatigue, but for those who wish to do it in a more leisurely manner, there will be intermediate services, enabling you to stay a night or more here and there.' Mrs. R. C. Allen was re-elected president of the higher primary school at Bordertown at the annual meeting, with Mrs. M. R. Smith vice-president, Mrs. H. Western secretary and treasurer, and Mrs. W Stone club hostess.
