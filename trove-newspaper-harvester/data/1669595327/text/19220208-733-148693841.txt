Thomas in the London '/Times,' that; it is possible to repeat this stage; -of about 250 miles, 40 times over, Which will take ns, say, to Australia, a! dist1 arice of .10,000 'miles. -iThe d'?iculty will certainly not be greater than *be tween London and Paris, owing to -the vagaries of our climate. ;? 1 The cost of running an 'aeroplane, owing to improvement in engines, improvement, in. design, and especially perhaps the devotion -of tlesign to ' the Commercial - rather than the' warlike aspect, is being daily rfcduced.

Which makes an tnOTmous 'differehCe,) ; we can now regard the practicability ! of an Imperial air mail. ' ? It ' must not be assumed that impair, mall traversing the Empire 'is .«i?;}iy going to be Ta direct conveyance be tween London and Sydney,' any more than-.a railway line to-day goes direct from London to Glasgow. Both meth ods of x. transport .'traverse populated areas and pass thiough mapy towns. 'An air mail, . for instance, to Sydney, .would start on its journey by convey-' ing a large amount to Paris, centres' in France, Italy, &ci Sfr Ross Smith, who Safelv' arrived 'in . AiistraKa? the -most, meagre organisation,' has -already blazed tlie trail;, passing through France^ Italy, Cairo, jDauias cus, Karachi, Delhi, Calcutta, Kan- ^ goon, Singapore, and so -on, . to Aus 'tralia. The air mail to Australia would naturally be dropping mail bags ail along His! route, to ;be.I conveyed' by. other modes of transport, orr perhaps even by short sufosidary air lines, to all centre's '.of populatipn along- the , route. ' ? ' One must assume on such a. great air route as I have outlined the sav ing of . days in the mails to such places off the route as Bombay, Geylon, Hong-Kong, and _ the hundreds of Inoaness 'centres with which we, as u.-itisn, -nave targe - interests, and wiiich ;from the 'aeroplane' -point of view must, almost be called :,'adja- . cent' to the route. At lOO' tinles an hour, which we know is; possrMe, tif accomplishment, an air- mail leaving London at 6 ,a. m . on Monday wonld -. arriye in Pans at l0.20 A.m. Mon day, Cairo 7 a.m. Tifesday/ Calcutta 6'.4S pjn. / Wednesday, .'.and, Sydney 12.4S p.m. on Saturday^ At' the same rate a diversion from. Cairo to Cap? Town would enable mail 'bags which left London -i 8 a.m. son Monday to be delivered in Cape Town .at S ?itn. on Thursday,' No on*, I think, couM, poieibly deery the enormous advantages to British trade and to the Srltilh Empire it such a scheme, were - l-6ulbl«, I titi only fay that tueh i scheme, on all the evidence which one can procure from pilots who have: flown all over ths world, la. perfectly possible to-day, . t COST OF fiUXNINS. .
