 THE SYDNEY BROADCAST. TOO WEAK TO RELAY. The British Broadcasting Corporation announces chat the Sydney broadcast to-day was too weak to relay, and the attempt was abandoned at 6.40 p.m. LONDON, December 35. Though the press reports showed that Sydney received the London special Christ- mas broadcast fairly successfully, Sydney's broadcast to London to-day was a complete failure. The BBC invited the listeners to stand by at 6 o'clock, and then at intervals o! ten minutes the announcer had to repeat that though they were picking Sydney up. it was too feeble to nAjroadcast. Finally at 6.40 p-m. he announced the abandon ment of the attempt.
