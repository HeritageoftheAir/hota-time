 RECORD FLIGHT OF FLYING BOAT Five-Day Journey From London SYDNEY, February 22. Daily air services between Bri- tain and Australia were forecast by the chairman of the British Overseas Airways Corporation (Lord Knollys), who reached Syd ney today in a new Hythe class fly ing boat. The Hythe established a new fly ing boat record between Britain and Australia, taking exactly five days and cutting the pre-war flying time by about half. The actual flying time was only 69 hours. Lord Knollys said that the flight was a possible forerunner of a re gular five-day flying boat service between Britain and Australia, which could be run hi addition to the present Lancastrian service. The British and Australian Gov ernments would decide at the Paci fic Air Conference at Wellington at the end of the month whether the flying boat service would be operated. Lord Knollys will attend the air conference as advisor to the Bri tish Minister for Civil Aviation.
