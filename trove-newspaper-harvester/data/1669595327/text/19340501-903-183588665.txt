 May Bay Celebrated Quietly In Sydney BRADMAN WENT EARLY . . ; i TRICKY WICPT FAVORS THE BOWLERS Brown's Style Attracts Comment LONDON, Monday. (rrom the special correspondent with the team; llie weather was ideal for the Australian test crickgters' first outdoor practice at Lord's Oval to- cly, but the wickets were tricky and gave a fore taste of the variety which they must reasonably expect to encounter during the normal English summer. The ball was rising and keeping low, and the bewildering un certainty of the conditions favored the bowlers, of whom Wall, McCabe and O'Reilly, wen the innst prominent. Wall, though deprived of his cus- torpary long run, brwled for a long spell with accuracy and good length. McCabe found the wicket so respon sive that he rooted up Bradman's ff stump in the course of the lat her's brief unimpressive innings. Klce'-wocd-Smith and Bromley were unable to find a length, and Grim- imatt f:.flfered some "passing." jWofdful made a solid knock, but lllaii ng and Barnett were unhappy. I Bromley indulged in some mighty ; 1: tting. Pohsford and Kippax bat- ' ied quietly while Chipperfield ob- 'ained useful all-round practice. The neatness of Brown's style drew favorable comment. Ebeling batted pa chily, but he bowled well, show ing fine capacity for work. He kept c. good length and made the hall lift.
