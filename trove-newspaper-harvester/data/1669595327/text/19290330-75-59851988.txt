 TO LONDON IN 13 DAYS! SOUTHERN CROSS FLYERS LEAVE SYDNEY Sluggish Take-off in 'Dead' Air SYDNEY, Today. At 10.46 o'clock this morning Squadron-Leader Kingsford Smith, Flight-Lieut. C. T. P. Ulm, Lieut. H. A. Litchfield (navigator), and Lieut. T. W. McWilliam (wireless operator) left Richmond aerodrome in the Southern Cross on the first stage of their flight to London. They hope to accomplish this in 13 days, but declare that they are not aiming to break the record established by Squadron-Leader Hinkler. To Wyndham, a distance of 1,860 miles, will be their first objec- tive, which they should reach early tomorrow morning. Although weakened by a severe attack of influenza, Squadron- Leader Kingsford Smith again revealed himself a master pilot by the magnificent way in which he handled the machine under conditions that were all against a satisfactory take-off. From there they will begin within a couple of days the long flight to England. 'We are not on a special record-break- ing trip,' Squadron Leader Kingsford Smith said today, 'but we have business in London, and it seems only reasonable that the most suitable way for us to travel is by aeroplane. 'We will go as fast as we can on the trip, but not wholly and solely with the object of an attack on the record of Squad- ron Leader Hinkler.' 'I am much more worried about my son's health than I am about the hazards of the flight generally,' said Mrs. Kings- ford Smith. 'He has been very ill dur- ing the past few days, and on Monday his temperature was 104. I believe that he was still running a temperature when the flight began.' '*I have the greatest confidence in the ultimate success of the journey. None of us believes that it holds the risks of the Pacific flight. Our main anxiety is Charlie's health. That is worrying me greatly.' Four hundred people cheered the crew of the Southern Cross on their way. Nine planes followed the big Fokker almost as far as the foothills of the Blue Moun- tains. Fifty cars and nine aeroplanes from Mas- cot landed the spectators at the aerodrome more than an hour before the great flight started. Squadron-Leader Smith, Flight-Lieut. C. T. P. Ulm, and their gal- lant companions, Lieut. T. W. McWilliams (wireless operator) and Lieut. H. A. Litch- field (navigator) were showered with good wishes and mascots. Women sought ex- citedly to pin rosettes and flowers to the tunics of the fliers, who were followed about by an admiring crowd. Scores of people asked the fliers to take packages and letters to England. They would easily have filled the cabin of the radio operator and navigator. Among the letters which were packed in Flight-Lieut. Ulm's case was one convey- ing greetings from Lord Stonehaven (Gov- ernor-General) to Mr. L. S. Amery (Domi- nions Secretary). The fliers also carried a personal introduction to the Prince of Wales. The air was dead when the plane was wheeled from the hangar at 9.50 o'clock. Heavy, watery clouds hung over Richmond. The three Wright-Whirlwind engines of the plane were started at 10.15 o'clock, and they ran for half an hour before the plane taxied toward the eastern side of the aerodrome. Part of this time was occupied by the fliers giving farewell messages, gramo- SQUADRON-LEADER KINGSFORD SMITH, who with his companions of the Southern Cross, has started on his flight to London. phone recording, and the remainder listen- ing to the beat of the engines, until the rhythm told that they were running well. At 10.35, when the engines had reached the maximum roar, the gale from the pro- pellers almost blew girls and little chil- dren away. The Southern Cross rose very slowly. Those who had seen the plane start on previous flights remarked that she did not lift into the air with the same elasticity as before. The Southern Cross was turned to the west, but still mounted very slowly. The humidity and lack of breeze made the take-off with 800 gallons of petrol an in- tricate task. Nine planes followed, but only the Can- berra was able to keep up with her great speed. In this plane was Mrs. Ulm. (Interviews with the womenfolk of the airmen appear on Page 17.)
