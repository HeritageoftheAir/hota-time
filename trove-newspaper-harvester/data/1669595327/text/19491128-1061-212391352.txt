 London one day, Sydney the next LONDON.— From London to Sydney in 36 hours— without hurrying. This is the record time which the De Havflland four- jet Comet is scneauiea w» take when it makes a test flight to Australia and New Zealand early next year. A De Havilland official men tioned the 36 hours quite casually when talking about the proposed ; test flight. . „ . „ "She wont be huipdng," 'said. "She'll cruise about 500 miles i an hour and will spend about 90 minutes on the ground requeuing. "She may break one or two \ records, but as far as we are /oncerned' that will be purely incidental. „ "Comets will start on the regu lar Australian run about 1953. but we want to see how they behave on the route "first."
