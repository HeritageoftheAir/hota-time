It was announced that it had been impossible for Flying-Officer Gilman to undergo tests but the committee was endeavoring to complete suffici ent tests to enable him to participate in the race. Following is the handicap schedule issued by the committee. Its compi lation is based on great circle dis tances between each checking point, a total of 12,314 miles: Race No. Estimated lute;).

Woods will be issued to-morrow when Wocds will possibly become the scratch man, failing which Neville Stack will be scratch. The different calculations are worked out on the basis of specified race regulations. Wocds. had another trying day. The pilot had been anxious to attain the ?best possible range and was reluctant to accept Bennett's offer to forego his flight with Woods at the last min ute in order to obtain greater petrol capacity. He cabled the American Department of Commerce appealing for a certificate of airworthiness on a higher weight than the Department originally allowed. Unless the De partment cables a favorable reply in the morning Wocds must be content with all-up weight of 4500 lbs., and also must decide whether the 180 lbs. of petrol gained in the absence of Bennett would compensate for the absence of a co-pilot and navigator. All 'planes will be taken from the hangars one hour before the first ma chine is signalled to start at 6.30 a.m. (4.30 p.m. Svdney Time). If the weather conditions are such that anv of the 'planes cannot be sent off by 10 a.m. oil Saturday, it Is like ly that the start will be postponed until Sunday, as all are anxious to have as much daylight as possible for their first hop. At present, however, there are pros Dects of favorable weather throughout Europe on Saturday. The Ratier Propeller Co. of Paris, makers of soecial variab!-e-nitch air screws, which are used in the Com ets. was Immediately telephoned for new propellors which will probably n't available until to-morrow morning. l'n the meanwhile the full extent of the damage cannot be ascertained although De Havibnds manufacturers of Jones' Comet believe they can re pair it In time for.the race. Mech anics are prepared to work all night. The accident is particularly unfor tunate. as It follows the illness ol the original pilot, Bernard Rufein who although 111 in hospital In London, ls consulted on all details of pre paration. Tli d accident again draws attention to the difficulties of landing the Co mets and indeed to the whole problem of the refractory imder-carriage. ADparrntly the signals are the same whether the wheels are up or down and are not always completely reli able. Though the K.L.M. Syndi cate's Douglass machine is similarly equipped, it Includes the extra pre caution of including a Klaxon horn with a glass, whloh, whenever the throttle is reduced, warns the pilot that the wheels are retarded. Many pilots are seizing on the Im provement In the weather for what mav be their last trials. Activity at the aerodrome increases daily, and an elaborate system of loud speakers, which call pilots, mechanics or air craft representatives Whenever re quired. has been installed. Should the present winds prevail, tb' machines will have the longest possible take off In running. The precise starting point will not be determined until the early hours on Saturday, as this important angle is dependent on the winds. It has been decided that the machines will be lined up level at' the start. Only the official party will b? allowed on the aerodrome. In order that the Press and public can be kept fully informed of developments, two avia tion correspondents will carry short wave wirelesses strapped to their ba'ks and announce authoritative de tails of the start, which will be broad cast by loud speakers in the public enclosure . Irrespective of any scratchlngs, tlio starting schedule must lee maintained The start can only b? postponed if the visibility is insufficient or tlie weather unsafe for flying , In her first solo flight In the Comet to-day. Amy Molllson after circling 'Wife Â»erodvm^ lanr^'d perfectly in her first attempt. She took oif again hut the second landing was bumpv. She brought it down hard on the W skid, landing on the wheels and th*n struck the trround. the port side soat being torn off. but Amv soon brought ihe Comet to a standstill. The dam age was not serious. Fltzmaur'ce's cvrwoieht is only 'OOlbs., the reduction ol whl1 not seriously effect Ills Bellanca's range, which, it is claimed will still excced 3000 miles.
