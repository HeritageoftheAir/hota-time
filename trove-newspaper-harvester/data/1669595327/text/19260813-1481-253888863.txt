 COBHAM'S FORECAST. Sydney to London in 8 Days. FUTURE OF AVIATION. SYDNEY, Thursday.â€”"We have been a nation of seamen. We will be a nation of aviators," said Alan Cobham, speaking at a civic reception at the Sydney Town Hall today. He said there was no reason why travel between London and Sydney in eight days should not' be possible. "Do not look upon aviation as a purely commercial enterprise," he said. "It is an instrument for the development of Australia and ol the Empire. This flight of mine )s not a stunt. To my mind the greatest performance ever put up was that by Sir Ross and Sir Keith Smith." Concluding, he said, "I hope to come to Australia again, and if I should arrive in a year or two at Mascot, and there is nobody there to meet me, I shalf know everything is all right, and that the arrival of an aeroplane from England is an everyday occurrence."
