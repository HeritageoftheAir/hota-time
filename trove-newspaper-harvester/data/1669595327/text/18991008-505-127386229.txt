 StiVEN-DAY PAPKUS. WILL THE LONDON EXPERI ENCE BE EEPEATED IN' SYDNEY. It is said that one of the four Sydney dailies will not participate in the seven day paper competition during the war. That there is no occasion lor the dailies issuing on Sundays was amply demonstrated during the war between Spain and the United States, when the 'Sunday Times,' as usual, covered tht news field. We have some of the daily newspaper cunaay exiraorcunanes, is sued during the war with Spain, before us now, and any sane citizen locking at them, would fail to find in thtin any warrant for their issue. The greed for pennies, not satisfied on the other six days of the week, prevailed, however, and out came the 'ex- traordinaries.' The daily that holds out of this talked of seven-day issue scheme must reap bene fit. The experience of London last year indi cates that. There the 'Daily Telegraph' and the 'Daily Mail' brought out Sunday issues, and after a month or two were forced to discontinue,. The people 'had no complaint about Sun day papers, of which there are about eight in London, but they objected to a proprie tary issuing a newspaper on every one or the seven days of the week. The Religious scction objected, the Labcr section objected, and those who believe in fair play and despise overreaching greeo objected. Advertisements and subscriptions were withdrawn from the seven-day papers ana given to those that considered six issues a week a fair thing, in tihe interests of their staffs and generally. New papers were started, pledged not to publish more than six daj^s a week, and strong support was promised them. Altogether the opposition to the new seven-day system of the 'Daily Telegraph' and 'Daily Mail' was so strong that both powerful proprietaries thought it advisable to go back to the old style, and they there fore discontinued the Sunday issue. ? Tho seven-day system is already in force to some extent in Sydney.
