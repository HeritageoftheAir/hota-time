 Last Days of Charles I. "CHARLES I. IN CAPTIVITY/' edited from . contemporary accounts by Gertrude Scnf.t Stevenson, M.A. (London, Arrowsmlth. Sydney, Dymock's) . Mifis Stevenson has provided a care ful and comprehensive study of the most Interesting phase of the career of this unhappy monarch. She draws . largely on the accounts of Sir Thomas Herbert, who was the personal atten dant and friend to the King, and who stayed in his room night and day from his imprisonment untitl his excution at Whitehall. The character of Charles- Is fairly indicated . without prejudice or favor. A large part of the work Is taken up by the official report of the trial In the Great Hall at Westminster, which be gan on January 20, 1649, and which seems to show that the poor King might as well not have h'ad the favor of one at all, for all the hope he had of acquittal. It is embellished with' significant and pathetic little incidents, such as this: "It Is to be observed that, as the charge was reading against the King, the head of his staff fell off, which he wondered - at; and, seeing none to take it up, he stoops for it himself." ' There Is also a report of the King's speech from the scaffold,, which was so surrounded with soldiers that he had no hope of making himself heard by the people. The description of the execution itself Is brief, and not un duly harrowed. He took the fatal stroke from a "disguised person," as.be lay on the ground, his head on a. low block. The work should be valuable to stu dents of history.
