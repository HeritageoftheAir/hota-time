 KEEP UP THE STANDARD. MIGRANTS FROM LONDON. SYDNEY, To-day. Referring to the press cables regarding the presentation of the British Parliament by the Secretary of State for Dominions (Col. L. C. S. Amery), of the report of the inter-departmental committee appointed to consider the effect of the proposed schemes of social insurance on migration, the Prime Minister (Mr. S. M. Bruce) said that he had read with interest the recommendations on the question of the migration of British families. He pointed out that the new migration agreement contained scientific provisions for the migra- tion to Australia of a larger number of families and married couples than heretofore. Under those provisions in every 10,000 migrants brought to the Commonwealth during the currency of the agreement there should be included not fewer than 3,750 members of families. Referring to the comments of the committee, regarding the present physical standards, Mr. Bruce expressed an opinion that experience indicated it would not be desirable to reduce the existing standards prescribed for assisted immigrants coming to Australia, but it might be well to reconsider the height limit. Fundamentally, the success of the whole migration question rested upon the formulation and carrying into effect of schemes of development and settlement to increase the absorption capacity of the country. That was chiefly the responsibility of the States, but to ensure the complete success of the working of the agreement the Commonwealth Govern- ment was prepared to co-operate in every possible way.
