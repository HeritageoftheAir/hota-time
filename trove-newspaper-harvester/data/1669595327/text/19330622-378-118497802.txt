 ULM SETS OFF. LONDON IN FIVE DAYS? Probable World Flight. SYDNEY, June 21. With only the commander at the controls, Mr. Charles Ulm's monoplane, Faith in Australia, left Richmond to-day for Derby, 2100 miles, on the first hop of a probable world flight, via Eng- land and America. It is stated that Ulm hopes to be in London in five days, and Calcutta may be his first stop. A total load of 14,500lb., including 850 gallons of petrol, was lifted by the plane. Assistant Pilot G. U. Al- len, who is also the wireless opera- tor, sent mesages out every hour un- til 5.30 p.m., giving the 'plane's position. At that hour, the 'plane was not far from Hungerford on the New South Wales-Queenaland border. After dark he could no longer give the latitude, but continued to give "O.K." signals each hour. While Ulm, Allen, and Capt. Tay- lor, navigator and relief pilot, were making final preparations last night, somebody climbed into the 'plane and innocently pulled a heavy wire which caused oil to flow from the reserve tank and flood the starboard engine sump, and then overflow to the ground. It took the mechanics two hours to rectify the damage to-day. Arrangements have been made at Derby to light fires near the aero- drome for it is expected that the ma- chine should arrive them soon after daybreak. If weather conditions are favour- able, the 'plane will make for Ran- goon after the petrol tanks have been filled to their capacity of 1230 gallons.
