 LESS THAN A WEEK. By Air from London to Australia. SYDNEY, To-day. Speaking at the civic reception to Wing- Commander de Pinedo yesterday, Sir Keith Smith said that these trial flights were blazing the way for a regular aerial service between Britain and Australia. He had no doubt that the route that had been followed by the pioneers would at no very remote date be the main arterial route between Australia and Britain, thus bringing Australia within less than a week's aerial journey from the Continent of Europe and London.
