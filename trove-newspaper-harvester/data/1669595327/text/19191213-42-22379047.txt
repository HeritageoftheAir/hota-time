Africa has many dialects, and in some of the most important of them "simba" is the native word for lion. Plenty of villages and towns are named "Simba." bo are numbers of the natives thernselvca, for, truth to tell, and in spite of the terror that he inspires, the lion is looked upou with admiration throughout Africa, and even in parts of that continent wheio he is not to be found liis reputation for kingly qualities is faithfully maintained. Native potentates in the land of lions often delight in possessing lion cubs us .captives. Usually the cubs are captured when the mother lion is shot, and they are kept until such time as they grow big aud. dangerous. Pets they can hardly be termed. When the cub is very young he is usually dull, lumpy, and passively truculent. As soon as he brightens up and becomes wide awake, then he has also become dangerous. Lion cubs in their infancy are commonly blundering, pig headed creatures, who are very much de termined to go just where they want to ro, and who gnimblin?ly protest when taken up bodily and set in any other path than that which looms in their mind'a eye. There are observers who Bay that the roar of a quite young lion—one jnst emerged from cub-hood—is exactly tha same as the note of the ostrich. When the African boy grows old enough to be sent out as a goat-herd, his con versation vnth other boys is much about lions. Ho is for ever daydreaming of the time when he will be big enough to him self go lion hunting. Meanwhile he has always an eye open for the possibility of coming across i\ wandering lion cub. Sometimes in an African village there will be a lion cub in a cage, around which the boys Jove to gather, discussing the points of the animal, and promising them selves that they will one of these days do great things in the way of slaying full-grown lions. Simba, in short, looms •large in the wait-till-I-atrow-up programmo of most of these young Africans. | Hunters and explorers being on safari, their porters and their askan (or armed soldier guards) are always eager for oil ! the lion fat they can possibly obtain. They firmly believe that the fat has cura tive properties in every kind of ailment. Some of them carefully carry a littie box of Hoi fat. Others swallow the wt as soon us obtained, certain that it will ward off all sorts of diseases that other wise might come to them. "Simba'a heart is medicine against lions." That is another fond belief of the natives. They cut out the heart of the 1 biggest Jions, sever the tip of the heart J and rub it all over their bodies, "to prevent being eaten by lions." If there is no lion, the heart of a Hones3 may he used in the same way, a makeshift sub stitute ' until a fine big lion can be sue oessfully hunted. And to the young boys, 1 1ho budding hunters for like purpose may be given the heart of a lion cub. Such beliefs are all very primitive and aavage. But they serve to show us lfow deen is tha impression that the lion has made on the imaginations of the people. They possess, indeed, a strange saying, which may be translated as: M Simba will have either your body or jrouv mind."— "Boy's Own Paper."
