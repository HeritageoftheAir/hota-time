 Klngsford Smith's Plans LONDON, TO SYDNEY. Ten Days' Six-Stop Plight. , - (Australian Cable Service) VANCOUVER, July 16.— Wing- Commander Klngsford Smith's brother has announced that an unnamed aeroplane company was negotiating with Kingsford Smith for a San Francisco to Tokyo flight next June with a four- motored plane having a cruising radius of 6000 miles. Meanwhile Kingsford Smith him- self is en route to New York, hoping to leave London on August 15 on a ten day's six-stop flight to Sydney. Harold Bromley is making another effort to organise a flight from Tacoma (Washington, State) to Tokyo, and if he succeeds presumably Kings- ford Smith's plan would be dropped. Bromley's first two 'planes crashed with loss of life, while hopping off and he at present is experimenting with a third— a single-motor machine carrying 500, gallons of fuel. Tests show that it has a maximum speed of only 90 miles, which makes it impossible for this plane to make a non-stop flight. It is altogether probable that Kingsford Smith will get a big chance to cross the Pacific to Japan next year if he will consent, or unless his fiancee, Miss Mary Powell, intervenes in any way. Klngsford Smith is plan- ning to return to San Francisco for his honeymoon, which looks like more long flights.
