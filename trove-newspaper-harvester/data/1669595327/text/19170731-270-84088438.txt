 POPULAR AIRSHIP TRAVEL. LONDON TO SYDNEY IN FIVE DAYS. At a recent meeting in the Central Hall, Westminster, Sir. 0. Holt-Tha. mas. delivered a lecture on commercial aeronautics. He said that, an hit opinion, aeronautics would revolution. iso the world not only from a commer cial point of view, but from a humani tarian point, uiurli more than it had revolutionised warfare. He was not one of those wlw thought Uiat com. tHctcial aeronautics were going to beat nut of existence railways and other forms of transport, but rather than flying would act as an adjunct to Hie present inodeti of transport. Aviation having suffered in the post from mere discouragement, the people of this country must gee to it that in the fu lure it was fully encouraged. From the business point of view speed wa» everything. A special Aeroplane, in the eensa. of a special train, would en able a. business* man to leave London in the morning:, do his business in Paris, and. bo Ironic again to dinner. It trould take him to Bagdad in a day and e-Ualf, or to New York in two days. Ceylon would become SI days from , liondon; Tokio, 4} days; Sydney, five days; Cape Town, three and « half days; Vancouver, three days. Many buaineBS men would smile at the idea of Using this mode of conveyance, but the only thing was to remind them that the; also smiled in the early days of motor cars, ana yet half the business to-day would take double the time to do if the motor car was not in «xistence. As for tlu- question of cost, it trould bo possible to run a profit «ble *ir service between London Bnd Paris at -£6 ner passenger, Vd. per ounce for mails, and 2/ each for par ncls of 31b. Constantinople o» Mos cow, a journey of 24 hours, might in volve a cost of £26 per ticket.
