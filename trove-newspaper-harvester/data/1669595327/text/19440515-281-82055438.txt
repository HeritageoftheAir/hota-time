 LONDON TO SYDNEY IN THREE DAYS ENGLISH VISION OF AIR TRAVEL In London on Friday night and in Sydney for breakfast on the following Monday was the vision of future air travel told by the til l'l/Lure iur urtvcx iuiu v**v Chairman of British Overseas Airways (Viscount Knollys) in a speech before the Royal Empire Society. He gave this picture of a journey from. London to Australia and New Zealand. "In the evening you will step into a large aircraft, weighing over 50 tons, and as roomy as a pullman car. You will fly comfortably at 20,000 or 30,000 feet above bad weather, cruis ing at between 230 and 250 miles an hour, and ultimately more. "Next morning you will be awaken ed in your bunk with early morning tea, to find yourself looking over the shores of the Eastern Mediterranean. After breakfast you will head for India, where you will arrive that same Saturday night. "Then across India to Singapore and Australia, reaching Sydney on Monday morning in time to do your work, or even go on to New Zealand, six or seven hours further on. "That journey will be for the man in a hurry, who will be able to do it without undue fatigue, but for those who wish to do it more leisurely there will be intermediate services enabl ing you to stay a night here and there." Lord Knollys, describing his recent air journeys across the world, said: "I found intense interest in Australia and New Zealand in everything con cerning the development of civil flying, but not enough is known in Australia about what is being done during the war by British air trans port."â€”(AA.P.).
