 LONDON IN EIGHT DAYS &nbsp; New Dutch Service Links With Qantas SYDNEY, Wednesday. It is now possible for a passenger by air to reach London eight days after leaving Brisbane. The bi-weekly Dutch service from Batavia to Amsterdam, which was in- augurated to-day, has been so ar- ranged that the 'planes will leave Batavia 50 minutes after the Qantas Empire Airways 'plane arrived from Brisbane. This will permit passengers by the air mail 'plane to be tran- shipped to the Dutch 'plane, and to make the journey to London in five and a half days.
