 Eight Days By Air From Brisbane To London SYDNEY, June 12. It is now possible for a passenger by air to reach London eight days after leaving Brisbane. The bi-weekly Dutch service from Batavia to Amsterdam, which was in- &nbsp; augurated today, has been so arranged &nbsp; that the planes will leave Batavia 50 minutes after the Qantas Empire Air- ways plane arrives from Brisbane. This will permit passengers by the air mail plane to be transhipped to the Dutch plane and to make the journey to Lon- don in five and a half days from there.
