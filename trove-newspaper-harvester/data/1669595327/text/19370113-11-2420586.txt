 LONDON - SYDNEY Eight-Day Air Service | LIMITED TO PASSENGERS SYDNEY, Tuesday. An eight-day aerial service be- tween Sydney and London is con- templated by Airlines of Australia in co-operation with the Dutch air lines which operate from Batavia. This would present a formidable threat to the Imperial Airways and Quantas Air Mail Service which takes 13½ days on its schedule. Although it is impossible to se- cure definite statements from «¡ther the Dutch representatives cr Airlines of Austra'ia, the ser- vice would of course be confined to passengers, and it is expected that it would secure the bulg of the passenger traffic, owing to the greater saving in time. The Dutch have persistently applied for a permit to enter Australia on a commercial basis, the last application being in February last year. In the event of the present nego- tiations reaching a satisfactory con- clusion, a huge fleet of new ait liners, capable of carrying 20 passengers, will be ordered. The date of the commencement of the service will depend on when the delivery of the new planes can bo made. Airlines of Australia is backed financially by the British Pacific trust.
