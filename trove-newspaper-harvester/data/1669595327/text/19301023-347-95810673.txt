 FLIGHT ENDED SMITH AT SYDNEY Thirteen Days From London. 20,000 PEOPLE APPLAUD. SYDNEY, Wednesday. Wing Cornmander Kingsford Smith landed at Mascot Aero- drome at 2.55 today, five minutes ahead of schedule, after a good flight from Brisbane. He was accorded a wonderful reception by a crowd of over 20,000 which had waited for some hours to welcome the intrepid airman, who had brought Sydney within 13 days of London. A fleet of 17 planes escorted the, Southern Cross Junior over the last few miles. The first person to greet Kingsford Smith was his fiancee, Miss Mary Powell, who kissed him affectionately, amid the cheers of the crowd. Speaking from a platform at the aerodrome, Kingsford Smith said that his flights hardly warranted the fuss that had been made about them, as he had had years of experience, mar- vellous organisation, and good luck. ''You should not think that I am the only one who has flown to Australia. There were many before me. I have tremendous admiration for Lieut. Hill, who is marooned at Koepang. He is certainly a wonderful sportsman, and I take off my hat to him." The famous aviator later was ac- corded an official welcome at Mascot Town Hall.
