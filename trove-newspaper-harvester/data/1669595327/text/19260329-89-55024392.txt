 LONDON TO SYDNEY. 12 DAYS' SERVICE FORETOLD. SYDNEY, Sunday. That an aerial tour of the world in 12 days is a possibility was the state- ment made by Sir Keith Smith at the Sunday afternoon service at the Lyceum to-day. He said that he had hopes that such tours would become common within the next 10 years. He explained the details of the flight from London to Ade- laide, and the organization that made it successful. He emphasized that similar organization would make possible a re- gular service between London and Syd- ney. At present airships were being con- structed in England, which would be capable of making the journey from Lon- don to Sydney in about seven days, allow- ing for stoppages for fuel supplies and embarking and disembarking passengers.
