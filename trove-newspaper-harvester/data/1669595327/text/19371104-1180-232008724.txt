 Three-day Flight To Sydney Now In Prospect FROM OUR SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE LONDON, Wednesday. UNGLAND to Sydney in three days, with one stop, at Singapore, is possible in the near future. Discussing the British Air Minis try's plans for an attempt on the distance record, the Aircraft Con structors' Society states that a Vickers Wellesley bomber would start from Cranwell or Mildenhall and should, even when throttled down to secure the lowest fuel consumption, aver- age at least 140 miles per hour to Singapore. This speed is 40 m.p.h. below the normal cruising speed. The society adds that the Spitfire single-seater fighter appears to have the land plane speed record "in its pocket." An improved Bristol Blenheim bomber, now being built, should also excel the existing record of 352.4 mp.h. The Dutch Government has placed orders for 50 Fokker military planes and Is negotiating for 50 more. They include single-seater fighters, twin-engine attackers and air cruis ers or medium bombers. The single-seater Fokker 21 is a fast, heavily-armed, low-wing mono plane. The attacker plane, Gl, is of a revolutionary design, and was first exhibited at the recent Paris Show. A gondola Is slung between twin bodies. It carries a pilot and an ob server, and gives equal view back or front. The machine mounts three seven- millimetre machine-guns and two 23- metre quick-firing Madsen cannons. The bomb load varies from 660 to 880 lb. The Fokker TV bomber Is described as one of the most formidable medium type produced by any country or at present being built. A second series will be built.
