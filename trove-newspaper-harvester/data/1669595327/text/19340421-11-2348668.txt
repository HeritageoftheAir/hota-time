 IN SIX DAYS LONDON DARWIN AIR MAIL Objective Armed At AUSTRALIAN STOPS MAY BE REDUCED SYDNEY, Friday. Mr. A. E. Rudder, director of QANTAS Empire Airways Ltd., which has secured the Singapore Darwin Brisbane air mail contract, said that although there were 24 scheduled stopping places between Singapore and Brisbane, a speedy service was hoped for. Many of these stopping places were soon to be eliminated, and, with night flying, it was hoped eventually to cover the journey from London to Darwin in six days. He said that already the passenger traffic available from London to Singapore was taxing the accommodation of the Astraea class monoplanes to the utmost. He said that for the Singapore service to Australia, 10 captains would be employed and 10 assistant pilot and wireless officers. The captains would have to possess a full naviga- tion certificate. Only three passengers would be carried on the Singa- pore-Darwin section owing to the amount of petrol needed to cover the 534 miles between Koepang and Dar- win across the Timor Sea. The passenger space had to be sacrificed to allow maximum amount of air mail to be carried.
