The prevalence of westerlies to-aav over a wide expanse of agricultural country in N.S.W. had the effect of hardening the Sussex-street values: of fodder lines. Should harsh and high winds blow for two or three days,' tbe gre=a crops planted for winter feed would quickly dry up, including ' lu cerne, barley, and rye, in addition- to the injury to natural grasses. . ? . . . .
