Wealth of Sydney Today Hgg Exceeds £800,000,000 // Only London Leads Her in Empire Race ' |SHK YDNEY, with a population of one million and a U9fik quarter, is the second city of the British Empire. Ranking next to London, Sydney is well ahead of Calcutta, Bombay, Glasgow, Birmingham, Mel- bourne, and Liverpool, which are next in order, and oeats Melbourne, which is more populous than Liverpool, by 25 per cent. When account is taken of Sydney's standard of living, which is to be measured by the distribution of wealth and income a head, Sydney is on an altogether different plane from those on which the non-Australian cities mentioned are located. There are no areas in Sydney where .six per sons and more sleep regularly in one room as in the islums of Glasgow, or in the Merseyside warrens of Liverpool. So Sydney is not the second city in the Empire merely by a short head, but by at least a straight from Melbourne, with . the rest laps behind. What, then, is this OUR Sydney worth— in mere money? DISTINCTION must first be made between private and communal material wealth in Sydney. The official valuations of land, im proved and unimproved, arc . made only in respect of ratable property, and under the Rating Exemption Act of 1931, all Grown lands are exempted, except those leased for private purposes or used for a State . industrial undertaking. Church, school, and University lands;.. parks, cemeteries, as well as lands vested in the Railway Com missioners, Water, Sewerage and Drainage Board, Harbor Trust, and the like are also- exempted. Broadly speaking, the valuations of ratable land and buildings apply to the privately-owned real estate of Sydney, while the public or more or less communally-owned properties, such as churches, etc., are not included in the valuations. LANDS AND BUILDINGS In the CiLy of Sydney proper the unimproved capital value, of land averages £15,000 an acre', and the average capital value of improve ments is nearly twice as much, viz., £29,000 an acre; the sum of these, . which is the improved capital value, is, therefore, about £44,000 an acre. As the total ratable area of the . City of Sydney is' about 3200 acres — the size of a small grazing property— the total value of ratable ' land and buildings in the city proper is £144,000,000. This, as already indicated in ' a general way, excludes Government House and grounds, Hyde Park, the Domain, the cathedrals and; churches, the offices of the various Government departments, except those rented by the Crown from private owners, and similar pro perties. Suburban land, of course, has a far smaller average value, « viz., about £1850 an acre for land and improvements combined, but its : larger area, roundly, 160,000 acres — the size of- a far western sheep property — makes up a total value of £298,000,000. The total value of the privately- owned lands and buildings in the metropolitan area is ' thus £442,000,000. This figure is refer able to ; the beginning of the year 1934, the latest date for which valu ation is given in the year books. MANUFACTURING PLANT AND MACHINERY The lands and buildings used in the manufacturing industries are included in the foregoing total valuations of real estate, but plant and machinery are not so included. The value of such privately-owned plant and machinery in the metro politan area at June 30, 1935, was approximately £27,000,000. ; This excludes the Government work shops. STOCKS OF LOCAL AND IMPORTED PRODUCTS Whatever the date for which the estimate of wealth is prepared, stocks of agricultural, pastoral, "and manufactured products will he in the hands of producers and dealers. It is usually estimated that at June ouj out null or the year's agri cultural produc tion, 90 per cent, of the wool clip, and one third of the year's output of manufactures. partly as raw — materials and partly as iiuiaucu ctJiu uimniMiea articles, is so held throughout the State.

The total value of stocks of merchandise, local and imported, is thus about £71,000.000. FURNITURE. CLOTHING. AND PERSONAL EFFECTS The value of these items, which 'nclude watches, clocks, jewellery, and the like, may be estimated at nearly £30 a head of the metropoli tan population, making a total for Sydney of £37,000,000. MOTOR VEHICLES This is the remaining important item of material wealth located in the metropolis. Live stock, imple ments of primary production in use, and mining properties with their plant form a large part of the material wealth located in the provinces of the Stale. Titles to these items in whole or in part may be held by pprsons in the metro polis. or elsewhere. But the purpose of the present valuation is not .to count wealth according to indi viduals' titles to it, but to count the value of the actual material items of wealth — lands, buildings, machinery, merchandise, household goods, etc. —which are located in Sydney, irrespective of the whereabouts of the owners. As a matter of fact, if we want to consider ownership, it must be remembered that there is a solid mortgage on Australia, as a whole', of £590,000,000 sterling (equal to £740,000,000 Australian) held abroad as a result of borrow ings hy the Commonwealth and the several States, apart from loans from abroad to municipalities and other public trusts. Getting down to the motors, roundly 265,000 privately-owned cars, lorries, cycles, buses, etc., are registered in New South Wales, and the value of those located at Sydney as headquarters, may be roundly estimated at £22,000,000. MISCELLANEOUS The remaining iteriis are not of the order of value of the groups already dealt with. The value of shipping registered in New South Wales was estimated at £4,000,000 in 1925. Total tonnage of steam, motor and sailing craft so registered had declined nearly 40 per cent, by 1035. The value of shipping which may be allocated to Sydney is probably about £2 000,001). Wireless sets — there are 300,000 odd licences in force in N.S.W.— may he worth £1,000,000 in the Metro polis. Coin and bullion in private hands (banks and - circulation) amounted to £16,000,000 in 1925, but since 1929, when Australia left the gold standard, we have had to be happy with silver, copper, and paper. The notes, of course, are not material wealth, and the face value of the metal coinage in the Metro polis probably does not exceed £1,500,000. If we cut out the token part of the face value (it is coined at 5/6 an ounce and the metal is worth about 2/- an ounce) to get its metallic material value— which would be its value for the mythical foreign looter — it would be worth little more than £500,000. Meticulous counting of the pri vately owned gold, other metal, and mineral stocks not already included in manufacturing stocks, live stock (horses, dairy cattle, poultry) in the Metropolitan area, would hardly bring this miscellaneous section much beyond £5,000,000.

Mr. ,C. H. Wiclcens, Commonwealth Statistician, then es- \ timated the total private wealth i of Australia at £2,475,000,000, and the total communal wealth at £825,000,000. The ratio thus shown, £3 private to £1 communal, was ; similar to but a little greater than ; the ratio shown in 1915 and 1921, i TOTAL WEALTH OF SYDNEY Using Mr. Wickcns's ratio we es- 1 timate £200,000,000 roundly as the ; communal wealth/ of Sydney at &lt; about the present time. The total wealth of Sydney, pri vate and communal, is thus esti mated at an amount somewhat ex ceeding £800,000,000.
