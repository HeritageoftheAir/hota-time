Amll-L9t; Australia, may extend its air services frdpt Townsvilte through Darwin to Batavia and " there link up with the Dutch airline, providing a days service between. Europe and Sydney. In the event of this happening the Australian company will operate a fleet of huge new airliners each carrying 20 passengers. Dutch representatives and Airlines of Aus tralia are knotvn to have been in close consulation on the matter. It may be possible to travel between London and Sydney in 8 days instead of 13 Â£ days as at present. The managing director of Airlines of Australia (Mr. G. A. Robinson) would not comment to-day on the negotiations. It is believed that the aircraft Airlines of Australia would fly to Batavia would be Douglas D.C. 3 S. giant planes, which the Dutch would be using in June. The start of the service would depend on when delivery of the new aircraft could be made. Airlines of Australia Is not subsidised and is not subject to Government con trol to the extent that Qantas Empire Airways is subsidised. The service of Airlines of Australia has the powerful financial backing of the British Pacific Trust. The nlr mall from Australia would still go by the subsidised service, but the Australia-Dutch service would hope to secure a majority of the passengers, due to the saving In transit time It could offer. The Sydney representative of K.L.M. and K.N-I.L.M. (Colonel Koopman) Can not discuss the matter at present. He said that the flight of the Douglas air liner, which is expected In Sydney.to-day is purely a charter flight and not for propaganda. The last application by the Dutch for entry to Australia was made In Febru ary last year. If airlines of Australia flies to Batavia the Dutch will not need to enter the country.
