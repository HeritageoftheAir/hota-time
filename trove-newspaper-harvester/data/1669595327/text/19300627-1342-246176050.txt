LONDON â€ž Thursday. HE Australian selectors' greatest problem in choosing the team for the second T est9 to be gin at Lord's to-morroiv, is whether to play Jackson in place of Ponsford. His recent form gives promise that Eng land will yet see the real Jackson, provided he does not revert to defensive batting. The wicket at Lord's is approaching perfection, and the weather is unpredictable, except that there is a slight tendency towards thunderstorms. Ci RIMMETT will be the magne' returning to the field refreshe " after a week's rest. So much c'.e pends on him that if his bowtin: is collared, or he is off-color, it v/il be hard to estimate how serious the position will be for Australia. Regarding Hurwood, the chatter 'om Australia amuses people "in the now" here. The selectors , in Australia need not worry why Woodfull does uot use Hurwood more. The fact is that he cannot afford to. Hurwood has ' been a disappoint ment, and everybody here is sorry, as he is a fine chap and feels his failure.
