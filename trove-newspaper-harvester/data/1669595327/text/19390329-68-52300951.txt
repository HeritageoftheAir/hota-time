 HALF DAY CUT IN LONDON AIR SCHEDULE SYDNEY, Tuesday. Half a day will be cut from the Sydney-London schedule of the Empire air service early next month, making the total time for the journey nine and a half days. This was announced to-day by Qantas Empire Air- ways after the departure from Rose Bay of the 100th flying boat to leave Sydney since the offi- cial opening of the service on August 9. The time has been saved be- tween India and England, with the result that Imperial Airways can now claim the fastest air service between London and Calcutta.
