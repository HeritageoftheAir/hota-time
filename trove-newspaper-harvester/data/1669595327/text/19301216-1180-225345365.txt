 mm Sydney-Side Surgeon in Early Days ("Sun" Special) ' I LONDON, Monday. | A. cold, disgusting reception is what Dr. Arnold, a surgeon 1 of the early settlement in Sydney, says ' of | the way in which Governor Macquarie met him. He describes the Governor as "hardlv accept- able to anyone." These observations are extracts from Dr. , Arnold's "Journals" and "Letters," which have been secured for the Mitchell Library, Sydney, at a sale at Sotheby's Rooms. The journal covers the period from August, 1 1810, to December, 1815, and records the voyage from Sydney to England, also the doctor's experiences as a surgeon on a convict vessel going to Sydney and after arrival. The letters, which belong to the some 1 - period, are full of interesting details about life and personages in | Australia. f .3
