 AVIATION REACH LONDON IN FIVE DAYS PILOT ULM'S OBJECTIVE! "FAITH IN AUSTRALIA" LEAVES SYDNEY SYDNEY, June 21. The monoplane "Faith in Australia" in which Messrs. C. Ulm, P. G. Tay- lor and G. Allam may circumnavigate the world, took off from the Richmond aerodrome this morning. Hundreds witnessed the departure. It is believed that Pilot Ulm aims at reaching London in five days. After a rest in England, they may fly to America, down through Honolulu to New Zealand, and back to Sydney. SYDNEY, June 21. With the owner-commander at the controls, Mr. Charles Ulm's monoplane "Faith in Australia" left Richmond to-day for a dreary 2,100 miles of the first hop of a probable world flight for England and America. A total load of 14500 lbs., including 850 gal- lons of petrol was lifted by the 'plane. The assistant pilot, Mr. G. U. Allen, who is also wireless operator, sent a message out every hour until 5.30 p.m., giving the plane's position. At that hour the 'plane was not far from Hun- gerford, on the New South Walesâ€” Queensland border. After darkness he could no longer give the latitude, but continued to give O.K. signals every hour. With Messrs. Ulm and Allen is Captain Taylor, navigator and relief pilot. At 8 o'clock last night somebody climbed into the plane and innocent- ly pulled a heavy wire, which caused oil to flow from the reserve tank and flood the starboard engine sump, and then overflow to the ground. It took the mechanics two hours to rectify the damage to-day. Arrangements have been made with Derby to light fires near the aero- drome, for it is expected that the machine should arrive there soon after daybreak. If weather conditions are favorable the 'plane will leave for Rangoon after the petrol tanks have been filled to their capacity of 1230 gallons, but as it was stated to-day that Mr. Ulm hpoes to be in London in five days. Calcutta may be his first stop.
