Reinsurance has been effected on the barque Maréchal de Gontaut which left Callao on November 26 for Sydney. SHIPPING NOTES. Having discharged the Melbourne portion of her cargo, the steamer Star of Scotland yesterday move from the Victoria Dock to Altona Bay, where she will reload a quantity of explosives for other Australian ports. She will leave for Sydney some time to-day. A late arrival last night was the timber steamer Rothley, from Puget Sound. On being granted pra- tique this morning she will berth at the South Wharf to discharge. Seventeen vessels left Melbourne yesterday for other ports. This will relieve the congestion in the port to a great extent, but Williamstown will not be affected. The German steamer Altona is still anchored in the bay waiting for a berth. She will probably go in to the new pier to-day, after the Banffshire leaves for Boston. This is the thirty second consecutive voyage to Melbourne of Captain T Hutchinson who is in command of the steamer Port Lincoln, which arrived from London yesterday Captain Hutchinson has been trading without a break between London ii 1 Australian ports since 1896 although he first iWted Melbourne in a sailing ship in 1888 He has been connected with the Milburn line for the whole of that time, and is now commodore of the left _ Oversea Vessels.
