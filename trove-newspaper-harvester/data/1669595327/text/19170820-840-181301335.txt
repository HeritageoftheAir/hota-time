 POPULAR AIRSHIP .TRAVEL. London toSydney in. Five Days. At a recent meeting in the' Central, Hall, Westminster, -,Mr. G.' -'Holt Thomas delivered a leoture on com mercial aeronautics,, he said that In liis opinion aeronautlos would revo lutionise tho- (world not only from a commercial point- of vlow, but from' a humanitarian; point, much moro than It had revolutionised warfare. He was not one, of those who thought that commercial aeronautics; v/ere going to beat out of existence railways and other forms of transport, but rather that flying would add as an adjunct to tho present modes of transport. Aviation having suffered In tho past from more discourage ment, tho people' of tljls country must see to it that in the future -it was fully encouraged.' From the busi ness. point bf view speed was every-' thing. A special aeroplane, In the sense of a special train, would enablo a business man to .leavo London in the morning, do his business in Paris, be homo again to dinner. It would take him to Bagdad in a day and a half, or to Now York in two days. Ceylon would becomo two and three- quarter days from London : Tokio 4 J days ; Sydney five, days ; Capo Town 3 days ; Vancouver three days, Mnny business men would smile at tho idea of using this mode of conveyance,' but tho only thing was to remind them that they also smiled in the early days of motor-ears, and yet half tlio business to-day would talto double tlio time to do if tlio motor-car was not In existence. As for the question of cost, it would be possible to run a pro fitable air service between London and Paris at £6 por passenger, Jd. per ounco for mnlls, and 2s. each for par cels of 3 lbs. Constantinople, or Mos cow, a journey of 24 hours, might in- volvo a cost of £25 per tloket.
