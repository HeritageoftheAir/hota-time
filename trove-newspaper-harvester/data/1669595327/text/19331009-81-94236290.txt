 LONDON MARKET FLUCTUATIONS Effect on Sydney Market PENNY DROP TO-DAY BYRON'BAY. Saturday. I The wholesale price of butter j will fall by one penny per lb. in Sydney 011 Monday, counter acting the two rises of a half penny each during one week of last month. Fluctuation of prices on the London market is responsible for the see-saw. Mr. C. H. Fraser, general manager of JSTorco Co-op., Ltd., who previously stated that any spirit of buoyancy must be tempered with ' caution, told a 11 Northern Star" representative that although it was foolish to attempt to prophesy prices it had to be conceded that the industrial population in the United Kingdom could not afford to pay a high price for butter. If an attempt were made to unduly force up prices, the great mass of con sumers would immediately restrict its use. Then supplies would exceed demand on the London market, and the ultimate result would be distinctly ad verse. STEADY RISE PREFERABLE Mr. Fraser, on that account, is of opinion that any sharp rise on the London market, such as happened dur ing September, should be viewed more with trepidation than jubilation. A steady rise could be taken as more likely to be permanent than sudden in creases as referred to. "I do not desire to sound a pessimistic note, but rathfcr one of caution," said Mr. Fraser, "and I do not think that the price will reach as low a level as it did in the past season. "The existing economic conditions in the United Kingdom indicate a retail rate of not exceeding one shilling per lb. while imports maintain their present high level. It is only by the lowering of imports that prices can be improved to any.great extent," he added.
