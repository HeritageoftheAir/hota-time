 THREE DAYS London - Sydney ULTIMATE AIM OF AIR SERVICE LONDON, Thursday. The "Daily Telegraph" says that before long, the nine days now spent on the flight to Sydney will be pain- fully slow. Already, the Dutch have faster times than the British services. It is not fantastic, that with night flying, the time will be reduced to three days. The paper pays tribute to Sir Ross and Sir Keith Smith, Sir Kingsford Smith, Campbell Black, Jean Batten and Clouston as the trail blazers.
