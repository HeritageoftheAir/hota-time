 SYDNEY TO LONDON IN TWENTY DAYS. THREE ROUTES OPEN. A MATTER OF MONEY ONLY. 'YOU WILL NOT PAY FOIt IT.' ('Sunday '/Inica' Special.) 'It's a fool notion, anyhow.' ' 'Why?' 'Because It Is.' 'But there must bo moro reason than 'becnuso'.' 'Woll, you might got It, but you can not pay for It.' ?'? ' 'Cannot ?' 'Well, you will not, and that's about tho samo thine.' 'I want to know what there 'is to pro vent a servlco between Sydney and Lon don .occupying not moro than twenty days ?' ? This was the question put to a shipping manager by a I'Sunday Times' representa tive yesterday. It was a continuation of .the scries of inquiries instituted a week ago. ? Tho question was productive of tho opening sentences. 'If I understand your question aright, you want to leave Sydney to-day and bo in London in three weeks' time?' said tho shipping man Interviewed. ' ' 'That's about It.' , 'Well, you can't do It.' 'Can It bodono In. twenty Oays' actual travelling If we take out tho stops ju rucl depots?' 'There arc vessels afloat that have suf ficient speod to .cover the distance, but you ennnot apply them to this trade.' 'But If wo aro ready to pay for it, can It bo done?' 'I will not say it cannot, but I am will ing, to stand to it that you ' WON'T FOOT THE BILL for such a luxury.' 'Why, If we can cut the tlmo of tho journey down by half?' 'Well', In tho flrst place, a steamer to cover tho trip would cost about £1,000,000. Sho would consume 1000 tons of coal a { day at tho necessary speed of 25 knots, as against ISO tons a day for 18 knots. With coal at, say, £1 a ton, that Is £1000 a day instead of £150.' 'Yes, but there Is 'the saving of time.' 'Let us go into It then. How does It ] work out? We will say twenty days' J steaming at 25 knots — that is £20,000. Say at 18 knots you take 35 days, that is a coal bill' of only £5250. Then you have to carry the coal; how aro you going to get ovor that difficulty. Anyhow, you are paying £15,090 to save fifteen days.' 'Well, at 25 'knots, it will take' five days to cover the dlstanco between Fremantlo and Colombo. That is the longest stretch. Over that journey 5000 or C00O tons of coal will bo consumed.' 'Yes, that is It, and the ship will bo like a balloon on the water when sho gets to Colombo.' ' 'But does this not apply to tho Maure tanla and Lusitanla?' 'Yes, but the wholo Journey Is covered In six days.' 'But that ilocs not alter tho conditions, IF YOU CAN GET OVER THE GROUND at tho rate you want to. Whon you got to Colombo you get enough coal in to start again on tho second stage.' 'Yes, that Is right enough, but it comes back to tho old argument. ^ \ro you pro pared to pay Cor it? It you are, then I suppose it can- bo done.' 'You must not overlook the fact that your express steamers cannot pass through the Suez Canal,' said (v commercial man. 'Steamers ot the size of , the Maurotanla would have to como via tho Capo route.' It has to bo pointed ou't*iii this con nection;- however, .that the i Capo route iB 'only 1200, miles further than- tho Suez, .route,: which- would-'raa1c6a';dlfferenco 6t' only' two'dnys 'to a 'Lusitahlai From Lon don to Capetown it .'is , 5S40 ' miles, or nlno Mays 20 hours' steaming for a 25 knot boat. There still remain nine days In which to cover the 5400 miles between Capetown and Adelaide. This route does not require inclusion of tho rail connec tion at the London end, the only rail route being that between Adelaide and Sydney.' AS FAR BACK AS 1907 tho all-red route proposals of Sir Wilfred Laurler showed the possibility of a 23 days' service between Sydney and London. Theso proposals only allowed for 18 to 21 knot boats across tho Pacific, tho 25-knot run being taken up on the Atlantic route. With 25-knot boats at each end, London could be reached easily from Sydney in twenty days. All that was reaulred to ensure the 23 days' trip was a subsidy of £500,000 to a steamship company, of which tho Canadian Government was will ing to pay £250,000. Tho time on the journey was outlined as follows by the officials of the Imperial Treasury, Board of Trade, and Canadian and Australasian, representatives:-— ,' \ ALL-RED ROUTE. - Atlantic Ocean .. ..,.. 25 knots ' l'acille Ocean ?

As a matter of -fact, a -25-knot servlco on tho Pacific side would bring the Jour ney to a termination under 20 days. It will be noted that throughout this ar ticle tho questions of oilfuel and Inter nal combustion engines havo been avoided. The matter as it relates to coal-burning ships alone has been considered. Next week consideration will bo given to, these two questions. ?
