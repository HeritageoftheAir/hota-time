 A LONDON WAITER 'Lord Thornton's' Photo Recognised in Sydney SYDNEY, To-day. 'The Mirror's' revelations- in regard to Max Maxwell's exploits in Perth under the name of Lord Thornton have received wide publicity in the Sydney press. Eric Morgan, ex head waiter in some exclusive London hotels, now living at Udeombe, is confident after seeing: the man's picture, is 'Charles,' at one tune on Morgan's staff. 'From Thornton's photograph in the 'Sunday Sun,' I am sure the man was with me in 1926,' Morgan states. 'He was about IS at the time and a good waiter. I think he came of good fam ily* for he bad the bearing and ap peared always to be in funds. Often when I handed him Ms wages he would Bay. -Oh, don't bother about that now. I've plenty to go on with.' 'His escapades WERE A SENSATION Among my staff. 'He several times appeared dressed as an attractive young lady in the Jonnsre of the hotel where he was a Waiter. At other times an obvious gentleman would stroll into the main nail of the hotel top-hatted and swing ball of the h tei top-hatted, but we knew, although not at first of course, .that it was Charles. I had to dismiss him but not before I had discovered that he spent his nights in good clubs or at swagger dinners and theatre parties. Once I mentioned coming: to Australia. 'My word,' he exclaimed, as though struck by a remarkable Idea. '?Australia now â€” what a great time out 'Jthere, rather, i must go oat to Aus traliar ; 'Tin certain he is the man who was having such s great time in Perth' concludes Mr. Morgan.
