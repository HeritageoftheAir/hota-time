 Dodo A Detail of the Day By E F Brasov London Methuen and Co Sydney Angus and Robertson This is the book which, having become involved in a whirlpool of London scandal, runs into eleven editions " Dodo " is thought to be a study very much from the life, and the original is a person- age of a very smart set in London At once there was a tohu bohn, and the fortune of Dodo is made Several things conspired with the importance of this lady to find the book interest There had been a run of women's novels, and the marriage question had got into the hands of hysterical persons, so that a man's handling was on please Then a beautiful tangle of literary and social ethics arose as to whether one should write novels about his personal friends, which is a very old question indeed, so old as to be almost fresh And j Mr Benson happens tobo/Wnfyo, a son of some one I It becomes interesting to think how the Primate of All England regards his son's novel There is a certain tone taken in "Dedo" towards the Angli- can Establishment which, can hardly be sooth- ing to a great magnate of that Church and the father of the writer of these sentiments It is necessary not to ignore these few circumstances, because at this distance, and read without much interest for a London sensation among smart people. Dodo does not quite justify its eleven editions Dodo is the daughter of commonplace people, the Vines, and she is loved by two men, Jack Braxton and his cousin Lord Chesterton! She elects to marry the latter, who is a good stupid fellow She tires of him desperately and soon, and Jack comes back from a tour abroad, and his society relieves her ennui Her baby is born, which she neglects and who is riding with Jack in the park when the death of the child from consul | none is announced to her Although friends, Mrs Vivian and others, endeavour to break off the intimacy with Broxton, it continues, without suspicion from Chesterford But an interview between Dodo and Broxton, when she challenges | him to elope with her and he refuses because he cannot be " such a blackguard," is witnessed partly by Dodo's sister Maud, who goes downstairs horrified and tells her husband This revelation Chesterford overhears He is an impossibly good person, this miserable husband, and he is so scrupulous as to act towards Dodo entirely as if he knew nothing So I much perfection cannot last, and that most useful duel ex machine, a spill while hunting, removes him after Dodo has made a deathbed scene of penitence Broxton now becomes Lord Chesterford, and after a decent interval his engagement With Dodo is announced But a certain austrian noble, Prince Waldenech whom the first Lord Chesterford had forbidden his wife to receive because he was " an awful brute," comes upon the scene, and at the eleventh hour Dodo, fickle to the last, accepts him, and the book closes with Broxton calling at her house to learn that " her Serene He gives has left for Paris " There is nothing much in the book besides this woman Certainly Mr Benson crowds his stage with automata, most of them very jerky But Dodo is everything The book pretends to be little but a promenade for her, and almost from the first to the final page we have this last analysis of the smartest of the smart set to day She must be a bewildering and awful phenomenon to the people who have been receiving with rapture the painfully serious and self-conscious women of the other school Dodo 19 human, and she com- municates life, this frank, audacious, selfish, and inconsistent woman She has no more cant than a child, and no more self-control She marries Chesterford because he is very rich, and she " wants to know what love is " She finds maternity a bore She quarrels with her husband about "Waldeneoh, and makes it up at once not by giving me, for she carries her point, out in order not to bother herself And at the very lost when she has promised to marry Broxton, sho quarrels with him about Waldenech, and marries that mysterious Austrian at last At the time she talks and talks Nothing is sacred, her keen eyes see everything, and her keen tongue reveals If Dodo's is the speech of smartness of the end of the century, it is indeed necessary for society to scatter to the four winds at frequent intervals in order to recuperate Dialogue there is hardly any in Mr Benson's work at is a feminine monologue of a fluency inconceivable when he does devote himself to conversations s deux, the author strives after epigram which is perilous even for people who have no reserve Mr Benson himself is rather provoking in pi opna persord He is capable of a good deal in the way of platitude, and his wife when he so far con- descends, is egregious But when the garrulity and the laboured wit and the attitudes are all taken into account, there still remains a striking picture of an individual woman and a state of society a " detail " of "Mr Benson likes the term, but really strong The test is that one reads Dodo, and ends with a sympathy for her The reader feels that here is a woman, and not a piece of furniture, but not a woman of the ideal type In contrast to that the whole tendency of the book might be quoted , serious-minded people will call it flippant, the dull may consider it improper, but allowing for all its faults it is a notable book from a 'prentice hand, and as Mr Benson matures it is possible that he may do something towards rehabilitating the English novel His subordinate people are in a few cases dis- tinctly Mrs Vivian, Maud, Edith Staines, Lady Grantham, but after all the only person that counts u Dodo
