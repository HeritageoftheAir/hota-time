 EIGHT-DAY SERVICE Between Sydney And London 20 AIRCRAFT TO BE USED SYDNEY, Tuesday. An eight-day aerial service - between Sydney and London is contemplated by Airlines of Aus- tralia in, co-operation with the Dutch. services which operate from Batavia. This -.would present a formidable threat,. to .- Imperial Airways and Qantas/'Air,Mail'Service, which.takes 18i days. ? on *' its ' current,.' schedules.' Although it.is impossible to ' secure a definite statement from eitherÂ» the Dutch -representatives or Airlines of Australia," .the service would,'? of course,.'be'confined to passengers, and it is expected.' that it would secure thc bulk of the passenger trafile. Because of the greater saving in time, the Dutch-have persistently ap- plied for a permit to enter Australia on a'commercial-basis. FORMER APPLICATION The last application was made In February of last year. In thc , event of thc present negotiations reaching a" satis- factory conclusion a huge fleet of new ai:- liners, capable of carry- ing 23 passengers, will be ordered. The-date of the-commencement of the service would depend on when -the delivery of the new aircraft . could be made. Airlines of'Australia is backed financially by the . British Pacific Trust' . .
