 LONDON TO SYDNEY IN 2½ DAYS; VISION OF POST WAR AIR TRAVEL LONDON, May 10 (AAP) : Leave London on Friday night and be in Sydney for breakfast on the following Mon- day — this was the vision of future air travel given by Lord Knollys, chair- man of British Overseas Airways, who recently visited Australia, in a speech to the Royal Empire Society. "You will, in the evening, step into a large aircraft weighing more than 50 tons, as roomy as a Pullman car, and you will fly comfortably at 20,000 or 30.000 feet over bad weather, cruising at be- tween 230 and 250 miles and hour," he said. "Next morning you will be awakened in your bunk with early morning tea, to find yourself look- ing over the shores of the East- ern Mediterranean. "After breakfast you will be speeding towards India, where you will arrive that same Satur- day night. For Man in Hurry "Across India you will go to Singapore and Australia, reaching Sydney on the Monday morning, in time to do your work, or on to New Zealand, six or seven hours farther on. "That journey will be for the man in a hurry, who will be able to do it without undue fatigue, but for those who wish to do it more leisurely there will be inter- mediate services, enabling you to stay a night or more here and there." Lord Knollys, describing his recent air journey around the world, said: "I found intense in- terest in Australia and New Zea- land in everything concerning de- velopment of civil flying, but not enough is known in Australia about what is being done during the war by British air transport."
