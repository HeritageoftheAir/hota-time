 IN 15 DAYS. Two London-Darwin Flights. CONNECT WITH QANTAS. &nbsp; SYDNEY, March 30. Two return aeroplane flights be- tween London and Darwin, con- necting with Qantas services to and from Sydney, are being arranged by Imperial Airways, Ltd. Rudders, Ltd., of Sydney, business agents for Imperial Airways, Ltd., re- ceived a cable to this effect to-day. The first aeroplane will leave London on April 4, and will arrive at Darwin &nbsp; on April 19, departing for London on April 27. The second machine will leave London on April 25 and arrive at Darwin on May 10, departing for London on May 17. Mr. Rudder said that the flights were evidently ex- perimental, and the 'planes would probably carry mails from England to Australia. Negotiations were being carried out with the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs so that mails could be carried from Australia to England by the 'planes on their return flights. It is probable that, should these flights prove successful, a regular service between London and Darwin will be instituted by imperial Air- ways, Ltd.
