 POPULAR AIRSHIP TRAVEL LONDON TO SYDNEY IN FIVE DAYS. -At a recent meeting in tlio Central Hall, YVostminstcr, Mr. G. Holt-Thomas delivered a lecture 011 coinmereial aeronautics. Ho said that 111 his opinion aoronautics would. revolu tionise, the world not only. from a coinmereial point ot view, but from a humanitarian point, much more, than it had ..revolutionised war fare. Ho was not 0110 oj- those who thought that commoreial aeronautics were going to boat out ot existence railways and -other, forms of transport, but rather that, flying would act as an adjunct to the present modes of traus- liort. Aviation having suffered 111 the past from mcro discouragement, the people of this country must soo to it taat m the future it wns fully encouraged. From the- business point of view speed was everything. A spec ial aeroplane, 111 tho sense of a special train, would enable a. business, man. to leave London ill tho .morning, do his business 111 Paris, and bo home-again- -.to dinner.. It.. would, take linn to Baghdad in a day and 71.. half, or to Now York in two days. Oeylou would bceomo 2 days, from London; Tokio, 4>) days; Sydney five days; Cape Town 34 days; Vancouver, tlirco days. Many business men would smile at tho idea of using this mode , of -conveyance, but. tlio only, thing was to. remind them that tlioy- .also smiled in . the early days of motor cars, nnd "yet half the business' to-day would' take double tho time to do if the motor-car was not 111, oxistence. As for the question of cost, it would bo. possible-to run a profitable air service between London and Paris at £5 per pnssengcr, 4-d' per ounce for mails, and 2s oacli for parcels of . 31b. - Constantinople or Moscow, a journey of 24 hours, might in volve a cost;. of £25 per tickot." :
