 ENGLAND TO SYDNEY Sir C. K. Smith's Flight. TAKE TWO AND HALF DAYS LONDON, October 12. Sir Charles Kingsford Smith plans to leave by air for Australia at the week- end. He expects to reach Wyndham (West Australia) in two days, and Syd- ney in two and a half. Sir Charles will fly non-stop to Baghdad, thence to Alla- habad, which he hopes to reach in 24 hours from London. Thereafter a halt will be made only at Singapore. He will reach Australian in four hops and hopes to better the record set in the Melbourne Centenary air race by Mr. C. W. Scott and Mr. Campbell Black. "NOT ATTACKING RECORD." Sir Charles Kingsford Smith told the "Sunday Graphic" that this would be his last long distance flight. He added: "I am tired and shall not attack the record from England to Australia. I am only keeping my hand in and am anxious to get home and start on the Tasman route. It is not a death-trap, but requires sea- planes. I also want a word with my family, whom I have not seen for months."
