 PERTH TO SYDNEY Air Record,: 8s Hours Officers of the Royal Australian Air Force are claiming, a new Perth-Sydney air record. Yester day a Lincoln bomber did the trip in 814 hours using the new navi- gation technique — single heading flight. Last week two R.A.A.F. Lln- colns had flown 12.000 miles to test this new system of naviga tion. The Lincoln left Perth at 3 a.m. eastern. standard time, and landed at Schofield (near Syd ney) at 11.30 a.m. Nine R.A.A.F. officers doing a specialised navigation course ar East Sale have flown on the trips. On completion they will be the nucleus of the R.A.A.F. post-war navigation training scheme. The R.A.A.F. is the first organi sation to pioneer single heading flight in the southern hemisphere. It has been used successfully lor trans-Atlantic flights for some years. -The route followed Is one calculated to give the aircraft best use of prevailing winds. | ' Fligfyt-I.iciilenp.nL A.
