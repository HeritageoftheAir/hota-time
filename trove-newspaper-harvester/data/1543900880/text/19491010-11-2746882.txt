 Mosquito Flew &nbsp; &nbsp; From Perth To &nbsp; &nbsp; Sydney In 6Â¼ Hours &nbsp; SYDNEY, Sunday. A R.A.A.F. Mosquito to-day &nbsp; established a new flying record by flying from Perth to Sydney in 6 hours 13 minutes. The Mosquito left Guildford, Perth, at 9 a.m. (Sydney time) and passed the homing beacon at Mascot at 3.13 p.m. &nbsp; The Mosquito broke the previ- &nbsp; ous record established by a R.A.A.F. Lincoln in September, 1947. Flight-Lieutonant C. Melchert piloted the Mosquito and Flight- Lieutenant W. A. Davis was navigator. After reaching Mascot, the Mosquito landed at Schofield's aerodrome. It will return later to its base with No. 87 Survey Squadron at Canberra. &nbsp; The crew of the Mosquito said they would have bettered the time had it not been for heavy clouds and adverse conditions in the Canberra and Monaro dis- tricts.
