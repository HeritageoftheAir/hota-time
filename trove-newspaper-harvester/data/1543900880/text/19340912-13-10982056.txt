Arriving at Sydney Sir Charles Kings- ford Smith demonstrated the planes ability to land in a small space. He landed at 60 miles an hour in about 150ft. Sir Charles Kingsford-Smlth said to- night that it would have been impossible to make a non-stop flight from Perth to Sydney because of the heavy nature of the ground at the Peith aerodrome He said ______________________________________ that he could not have left the ground with the quantity of petrol required for the non-stop flight, so he decided to call at Adelaide. When he tried lo take-off at Perth on Sunday the 'plane was carrying 380 gallons of petrol for the non-stop flight. To-day it carried only 240 gallons. This reduced the weight of the 'plane by nearly half a ton. The aviator said that the flight both ways showed that under modern flying conditions, with the type of passenger 'planes being used across America, re- gular daily trans-Australian flights could be made in future, passengers having an early breakfast in Sydney and dinner at Perth in the evening. Super Plume (Ethyl type) and Mobiloil were used on the flight.
