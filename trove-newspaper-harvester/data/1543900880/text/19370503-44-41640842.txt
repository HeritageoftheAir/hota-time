 SPEEDING UP TRANS CONTINENTAL TRAINS Saving Of 24 Hours From Perth To Sydney MELBOURNE. May 2. By the end of this year the railway journey between Sydney and Perth will be reduced by 24 hours. The Minister for the Interior (Mr. Paierajni taid on Saturday that this saving of time would be made possible arter the openinc of the new line be tween Red Hill and Port Augusta in South Australia and a revision of run ning times by lh e railway authorities in Vicioria, Western Australia, and South Australia. The new route between Port Augusta and Red Hill would probably be ready in August. Mr. Paterson added. This would reduce the journey by 70 miles. Eight high-speed passenger locomo tives which had been ordered would substantially reduce the travelling time between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlle. The difficulty in obtaining steel for the new locomotives had delayed de liveries, so that it would be impossible to take full ad\-antage of the shorter route through Red Hill before the end of 1937. A new interim timetable, however, would operate from the com pletion of the line in August until the new locomotives were delivered. Long non-stop runs would be at tempted across the continent, and the tender for the new locomotives would contain sufficient coal for 500 miles and water for 200 miles, Mr. Paterson explained.
