Throughout the whole journey the intrepid motorist used “Shell” Oil and Spirit and on his arrival at Syd ney spoke in high terms of the won derful quality . of' these products. Dr. Manning left Perth at' 9 p. m. on Monday, 16th September and ar-. rived in Sydney at 10.22 p.m. on Friday, 20th September. His route lay via Eucla, Port Augusta, Mildura and Cootamundra, along which many exacting tests had to be faced, but all of these were , readily overcome by the car with the aid of Shell Oil and Spirit. The previous record for this trip was_ established by Wizard Smith, whose full travelling time was 106 hours 43 minutes. It will therefore: be seen that this time has been re duced by 11 hours 51 minutes in the present instance, a record which will bear the closest inspection and show all discerning motorists that “Shell” products are the best.
