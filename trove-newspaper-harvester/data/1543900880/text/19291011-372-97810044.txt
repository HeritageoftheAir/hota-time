 PERTH-SYDNEY MOTOR CAR RECORD. DR. MANNING BEATS WIZARD SMITH'S RECORD BY 11 HOURS 51 MINUTES. ---------- Another laurel has been added to the long list of Shell records by Dr. Manning, who, driving a stock &nbsp; model Chrysler Sedan, travelled from Perth to Sydney in the record time of 3 days, 22 hours and 52 minutes. Throughout the whole journey the intrepid motorist used "Shell" Oil and Spirit and on his &nbsp; arrival at Sydney spoke in high terms of the wonderful quality of these products. Dr. Manning left Perth at 9 p.m., on Monday, 16th. September, and arrived in Sydney at 10.22 p.m. on Friday, 20th. September. His route lay via Euela, Port Augusta, Mil- dura and Cootamundra, along which many exacting tests had to be faced, but all of these were readily over come by the car with the aid of Shell Oil and Spirit. The previous record for this trip was established by Wizard Smith, whose full travelling time was 106 hours 43 minutes. It will therefore be seen that this time has been re- duced by 11 hours 51 minutes in the present instance, a record which will bear the closest inspection, and show all discerning motorists that "Shell" products are the best.
