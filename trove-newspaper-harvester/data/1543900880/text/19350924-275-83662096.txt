 SYDNEY MAILS GAIN 18 HOURS Effect of New Air Service PERTH BENEFITS The information that Holymans Airways Pty. Ltd. have arranged to establish a daily air service be tween Melbourne and Sydney will ha\re an important bearing on Perth air mails for New South Wales and Queensland. The time taken by the mails to reach Syd ney, from Perth, will be shortened by nearly 20 hours. At present, the air mails which leave Perth on Tuesday mornings, for the Eastern States, are carried by train from Adelaide to Melbourne, and ar rive in Melbourne at 10.30 a.m. on the following Thursday, and at Sydney, at 11 a.m. the next day. With the new air service in opera tion, the mails will reach Sydney at 5 p.m. on Thursday â€” 18 hours earlier than they do with the present service. Mails leaving Perth on Tuesday for Brisbane will arrive at their destina tion a day earlier. Letters bearing an air-mail fee, post ed in this State for New South Wales and Queensland, for despatch by the transcontinental train on Saturdays, will, after reaching Melbourne, be car ried by air to Sydney with a similar gain in time. MELBOURNE-HOBART SERVICE The Holymans Airways Pty. Ltd. have also arranged to duplicate their Melbourne-Hobart air service. This service will link up with the Mel bourne-Sydney-Brisbane air service.
