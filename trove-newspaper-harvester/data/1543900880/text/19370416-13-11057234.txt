Darwin-Adelaide Service ADELAIDE, Thursday.-The secretary of the Adelaide Chamber of Commerce (Mr. J. A. Riley) has written to the Acting Prime Minister (Dr. Page) suggesting the establishment of an airmail service from Darwin to Adelaide. The letter points out that business men in Adelaide arc at a serious, disadvantage because the ovcisca mails now arrive so late. Mr. Riley sug- gested that the only'remedy Is the distri- bution of airmails .from the first landing point, which would pr√≥vido simultaneous delivery, in various capitals. For this rea- son It has been recommended that a land- ing ground adaptable to all climatic emer- gencies be'prepared at Tennant Creek.
