 PERTH-SYDNEY MOTOR CAR &nbsp; RECORD. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dr. Manning Beats Wizard Smith's Record by 11 hours &nbsp; 51 minutes. Another laurel has been added to the long list of Shell records by Dr. Manning, who, driving a stock model &nbsp; Chrysler Sedan travelled from Perth to Sydneyin the record time of three &nbsp; days, 22 hours and 52 minutes. Throughout the whole journey the in- trepid motorist used "Shell" oil and &nbsp; spirits and on his arrival at Sydney spoke in high terms of the wonderful quality of these products. Dr. Manning left Perth at 9 p.m.on Monday, 16th September, and arrived in Syd- &nbsp; ney at 10.22 p.m. on Friday, 20th &nbsp; September. His route lay via Eucla, &nbsp; Port Augusta, Mildura, and Cootamun- &nbsp; dra, along which many exacting tests had to be faced, but all of these were readily overcome by the car with the aid of Shell oil and spirit. The pre- vious record for this trip estab- lished by Wizard Smith, whose full travelling time was 105 hours 43 min- utes. It will therefore he seen that this time has been reduced by 11 hours 51 minutes, in the present instance, a record which will bear the closest in- &nbsp; spection and show all discerning motorists that "Shell'' products are the best. &nbsp; &nbsp;
