 AIR AND RAIL Sydney to Perth in 35 Hours TRIP BEING ARRANGED Melbourne, October 3. To demonstrate what can be accomplished by the co-ordina- tion of aeroplane and railway services, Australian Aerial Ser- vices, Ltd., and the Common- wealth Railways Department will complete arrangements soon for a combined air and rail journey across Australia, from Sydney to Perth. The whole journey is estimated to occupy only 35 hours. It will be possible to take breakfast in Sydney one day and dinner in Perth the next day. It is not intended that the demonstration should be in the nature of a record-breaking stunt, as it is desired to afford passengers the great- est possible comfort. There will be no night flying. The schedule pro- vides that the middle part of the jour- ney, from Port Augusta to Ooldea, shall take place at night, so that dur- ing the period of darkness the travel- lers will be in a well equipped train with hot and cold showers, a dining saloon, and sleeping compartments. No part of the flight will be over water or inhospitable country, and to ensure this provision the route has been care- fully surveyed. The total distance to be covered is 2,187 miles. Against 35 hours by com- bined air and rail travel the train journey for the whole distance takes 108 hours. By steamer tbe distance is 2,440 miles, and the time taken is 264 hours. The time-table for the first journey is:—Leave Sydney by aeroplane in the morning and arrive at Port Augusta at 5.30 p.m. on the same day. Take the East-West ex- press from Port Augusta at 6 o'clock that evening and arrive at Ooldea at 6.30 on the following morning. Leave Ooldea by aeroplane at 7 a.m., reach- ing Perth at 6.30 p.m. Business men from Victoria and New South Wales will form the first party to make the trip. The first class single fare will be £27 18/.
