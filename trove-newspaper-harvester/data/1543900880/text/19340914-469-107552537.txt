 KINGSFORD SMITH'S FLIGHT. Perth to Sydney in 10 Hours 20 Minutes. 029 MILES AN HOUR. Breakfast in I'orfch; luncheon in Adelaide; dinner in Sydney! Sir Charles Kingsford Smith was able to have these widely-separated meals "on Tuesday and to sleep that night 2125 miles from where he slent on Monday night, because he flew from Perth to Sydney, viu Adelaide, in 10 hours 20 minutes, at an average speed of 229 miles an hour! In making this remarkable flight in his new Lockheed-Altair mono plane, Lady Southern Cross, Sir Charles Kingsford Smith shattered the records for flights between Perth and Adelaide, and between Adelaide and Sydney. He reduced both records by more than half. The monoplane was actually in the air only 9 hours 32 minutes, as the stay at Adelaide for lunch and re fuelling of the plane occupied 48 minutes, The Perth-Adelaide section of the flight took six hours, the average speed being 233 miles an hour. On 1 the Adelaide-Sydney section of the ] flight the 'plane encountered head j winds and the speed was slightly re l duced. The speed throughout, how | ever, was very even. Near Broken j Hill, Sir Charles met strong easterly ? winds and climbed several thousands : of feet at times to escape them and ! to take advantage of a more favorable l breeze higher up. On landing at Sydney, Sir Charles . Kingsford Smith demonstrated the j 'plane's ability tp land in a short space. His "speed suddenly reduced and he landed at a speed of only 60 miles an hour in about 150 feet. It was a splendid landing. Water splash ed freely as the 'plane ran along the rain-soaked aerodrome.
