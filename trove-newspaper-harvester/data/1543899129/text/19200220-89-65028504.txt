 FLYING KNIGHT AS PROPHET. SYDNEY TO LONDON, 64 HOURS. v SYDNEY, February 19. Sir Rosa Smith and Sir Keith Smitu were entertained at luncheon by the Insti tute of Journalists to-day. Mr. J. C. Watson remarked that the names of these aviatora would live in Aus tralian history with that of Lord Forrest and other pioneers. Sir Ross Smith, who was enthusiastically received, said it seemed to him Australia was not alive to the possibilities of avia tion, or how aeroplanes were going to assist in the eocial and industrial develop ment of the Commonwealth. Australia roust eec to it tnat further facilities were provided, for the future internal and ex ternal communications of this country would largely depend on the aeroplane. In the course of an interview to-day, Sir Ross Smith expressed tho view that ?within a year, or a few yeara at the latest, aeroplanes would be regularly flown at the rate of 200 miles an hour. Allowing for short stoppages for fuel or a quick ?change of machines, thia would bring Sydney -within 64 hours actual flying time of London. Even with the facilities al readv available, the voyage^ to London could easily be accomplished in 18 to 20 days, in short, comfortable daily stages; and, with mcreased experience and the im provement ot machines, intermediate sta tions could be cue out, and the voyage shortened bv six or eight days.
