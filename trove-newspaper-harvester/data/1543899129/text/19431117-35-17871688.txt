 POST-WAR AIR TRANSPORT Sydney to London in 60 Hours Sydney may be brought with- in 60 flying hours of London after the war. This possibility was mentioned by Mr. Hudson Fysh, managing director of Qantas Empire Airways, Ltd., in an address to the Rotary Club yester- day. Mr. Fysh, who spoke on a recent visit he made to Britain and the United States, predicted enormous in- creases in aerial transport immedi- ately after the war. He said that the flying time of the trip from Australia to Scotland was actually only 74 hours 25 minutes, and the whole trip, including stops in the United States and Canada, occu- pied only five and a half days. Some of it was done at a height of 17,000 feet, with the temperature in parts 25 below zero, and oxygen had to be freely used by both passengers and crew. 450 M.P.H. AIMED AT The aircraft Industry to Britain was what the wool and allied industries were to Australia There were more than 1,000,000 persons employed in the construction of British aircraft, and the one ideal was to make them bigger and better. Now 400 miles an hour was not sufficient speed, and 450 or more miles an hour was being aimed at. Intensive research and experimentation were going on inces- santly and the war air weapons of to-day would be the Queen Marys of the air to-morrow. Similar developments were taking place in the United States. The main aerodrome owned by the Municipal Council of New York permitted 244 landings and takings-off within the 24 hours, and now a much larger aerodrome was to be constructed.
