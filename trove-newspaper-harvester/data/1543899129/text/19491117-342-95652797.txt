 London to Sydney in Thirty-six Hours HOPES FOR JET COMET London, Nov. 16.â€” A De Havil land four-jet Comet will fly from London to Sydney in 36 hours when it makes its test flight to Australia and New Zealand early next year, a De Havilland spokes man said to-day. 'She won't be hurrying and will probably land, at Cairo, New Delhi, Singapore. Darwin, Sydney and Auckland. She will cruise at about 500 miles an hour and spend about 90 minutes on the ground refueling,' he said. . 'She may break one or two re cords, but as far as we are con cerned that will be purely inci dental. The aim of the flight is to see how she likes the trip. 'Comets, will start on the regu lar Australian run about 1953, but we want to see how they behave on the route first. We were very pleased with her recent flight to Africa and back. There is no truth in reports that the fuel consumption was disappointing. She is all we hoped she would be,'
