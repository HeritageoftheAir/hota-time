 LondÂ®n=Sydaey Take 36 Hours LONDON, Wednesday. - The De Havilland four jet Comet will fly from London to Sydney in 36 hours, when it makes its test flight to Aus tralia and New Zealand, early next year, a De Havilland spokesman said today. He saiu: "She won't be hurrying. She will probably land at Cairo, New Delhi, Singapore, Darwin, Syd ney and Auckland. She will cruise at about 500 m.p.h. and spend about 90 minutes on the ground refuel ling". The spokesman added: "She may break one or two records, but as far as we are concerned that will be purely incidental. The aim of the flight is to see how she likes the trip. "The Comets will start on the regular Australian run about 1953, but we want to see how they behave on the route first- We are very pleased with her recent flight to Africa and back. "There is no truth in reports'that fuel consumption was disappointing. She's all we hoped she would be".
