 London-Sydney 24 Hours? BRISBANE, Wednesday. â€” Within 15 years, huge jet-propelled air liners will fly from London to Sydney in 24 hours, said the managing director of QANTAS, Mr. Hudson Fysh, in Bris- bane to-day. He was commenting on the flight from London to Sydney in 58 hours 12 min- utes by the first of the five Lancastrians, bought by QANTAS to operate on the London-Sydney run. He said that the air liners would travel faster than sound and sealed pressure cabins would allow the aircraft to fly at a height of 10 miles.
