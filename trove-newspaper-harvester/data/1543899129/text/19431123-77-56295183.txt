 SYDNEY TO LONDON IN 60 HOURS Sydney may be brought within 60 flying hours of London after the war. This possibility was men- tioned by Mr Hudson Fysh, manag- ing director of Qantas Empire Air- &nbsp; ways Ltd, in an address to the Sydney Rotary Club. Mr Fysh, who spoke on a recent visit he made to Britain and the United States, predicted enormous increases in aerial transport imme- diately after the war. He said that the flying time of the trip from Australia to Scotland was actually only 74 hours 25 minutes, and the whole trip, in- cluding stops in the United States and Canada, occupied only five and a half days. Some of it was done at a height of 17,000 feet, with the temperature in parts 25 below zero, and oxygen had to be freely used by both passengers and crew. The aircraft industry to Britain was what the wool and allied indus- tries were to Australia. There were more than 1,000,000 persons employed in the construction of &nbsp; British aircraft, and the one ideal was to make them bigger and bet- ter. Now 400 miles an hour was not sufficient speed, and 450 or more miles an hour was being aimed at. Intensive research and experi- mentation were going on inces- santly and the war air weapons of today would be the Queen Marys of the air tomorrow. Similar developments were tak- ing place in the United States. The main aerodrome owned by the Municipal Council of New York permitted 244 landings and tak- ings-off within the 24 hours, and now a much larger aerodrome was to be constructed.
