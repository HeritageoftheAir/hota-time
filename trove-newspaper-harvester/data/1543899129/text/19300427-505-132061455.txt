 ? *. ? From London to Australia NEW AVIATION MARVELS ('Sunday Times' Service.) LONDON, Saturday. CJYDNEY to London in 24 hours I Louis Bleriot, famous aviator and aviation engineer, lias almost com pleted an aeroplane capable of flying three-quarters oÂ£ the distance to Aus tralia without stopping, and with British machines now being prepared to do 400 ni.p.h., it is hoped that these will be allied with the weight-carrying craft of Bleriot, and will be able to fly from London ? to Australia, in little more than one -day. 'DLERIOT has., been working on his task for 20 years. His machine is an immense monoplane, Letter stream lined than any previous flying machine, and the weight has been so lessened that it will ascend with tremendous weights. The wings are hollow, aud suuk iu them are stream-lined compartments for pilots and engineers. So rapid is the development iu air craft, that British aviation circles predict phenomenal speeds from planes now un der construction. British experts declare that within. five years standard service machines will travel at rates now thought possible only from racing craft.
