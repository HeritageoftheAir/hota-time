 LONDON TO SYDNEY BY AIR Plane Does Trip In 80 Hours The first Lancastrian mail plane on the new service from England reached Sydney on Monday after 49 hours' actual flying time. The total time for the journey was a little over 80 hours. The last 2.500 miles stage, from a Western Aus- tralian airport to Mascot, took nine hours. The plane carried two pas- sengers, 200 lb. of official mail, and last Thursday's London news- papers. In command of the plane were Capt. K. Howard and Capt. H. B. Hussey, of Qantas Empire Airways. The passengers were Adml. C. S. Standford and Cmdr. H. Duncan, of the RN. The trip was described as pleasant and un- eventful.
