 LONDON-SYDNEY. IN FD7TY HOUB8. LONDON. February 7. Fifty-hour sub-stratosphere flights from London to Sydney in 300'miles an hour planes may be one of the features of the huge upsurge in post-war civil fly- ing. % Mr. Leslie Runciman, director-general of the British Overseas Airways Cor- poration, told the "Sunday Mail" this after a five months' tour of Empire air routes. The principal difficulty, he said, would be whether people were prepared to pay huge fares for sub-stratosphere flying.
