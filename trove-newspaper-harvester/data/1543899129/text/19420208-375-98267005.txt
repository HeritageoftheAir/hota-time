 LONDON-SYDNEY IN FIFTY HOURS LONDON, February 7.— Fifty- hour sub-stratosphere flights from London to Sydney in 300 miles an hour planes may be one of the features of the huge upsurge in post-war civil flying. I Mr. Leslie Runclman, director general of the British Overseas Airways Corporation, told thei Sunday Mail this after a five months' tour of Empire air routes. The principal difficulty, he said, would be whether people were pre pared to pay huge fares for sub stratosphere flying. — S.-M. Special.
