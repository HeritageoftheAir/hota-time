 SYDNEY-LONDON IN 72 HOURS Post-War Plans of Qantas Airways MELBOURNE, Monday.- Plans for post-war operations by Qantas Empire Airways Ltd. include a service which will allow Melbourne and Sydney to be linked with London in 72 hours flying night and day, and with sleeping ac. commodation for passengers. This was announced to-day by the man aging director of the company (Mlr. Hud eon Fysh). He said this would actually allow an answer to an air mail letter to be received from London in seven or eight days of writing it in Australia. It was not possible yet to state the com pany's proposals for the poet-war opera tion of air services in and out of Australia, but these were being planned. Qantas had reopened an Empire wartime air connection by operating Catalina flying boats between Australia and Karachi since July, 1943. Australia and Karachi were linked by the Catalinas in 48 hours. in cluding stops, which was twice as fast as the old Empire flying boat service which stopped overnight. This Catalina service had now been supplemented by a fast land plane service styled the "kangaroo service" which ran from Australia to Ceylon. This service again provided greater speed, and allowed a passenger leaving Australia to be in India inside 24 hosirs.
