 LONDON-SYDNEY, 36 HOURS The Dc Havilland four-jet Comet will fly from London to Sydney in 36 hours when it makes its test flight to Australia and New Zealand early next year. De Havil land spokesman said' in Lon don. "She will not be hurrying," he said. "She will probably land at Cairo, New Delhi, Singapore, Darwin, Sydney and Auckland. "She will cruise about 500 miles an hour and spend about 90 minutes on the ground re fuelling." The spokesman added: "She may break one or two records, but as far as we are concerned that wil be purely incidental. The aim of the flight is to see how she likes the trip. "Comets will start on the regular Australian run about 1953, but we want to see how they behave on the route first. "We were very pleased with her recent flight to Africa and back. There is no truth in the reports that the fuel consump tion was disappointing. She is all that we hoped she would be."
