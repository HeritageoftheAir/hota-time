 46 HOURS FROM SYDNEY TO LONDON IS POSSIBLE SAYS QANTAS OFFICIAL 'If ihe war had not intervened the plans for a 74 hour service be'.v.'cer. England and Australia would have become a fact this year, and would have supplemented the Flying Boat service with a fast night and day land plane service,' said Mr. Hudson Fysh, vice-chairman of Qanlas to-day, when addressing the Constitutional Club. 'However, if the German bomber, which will shortly be coming into production, were turned to commercial use, it could fly from Sydney lo London in 46 hours flying tirrfe, or in well under three days allowing full stops. 'This German plane if used for com mercial flights, could carry a 15.000 II). load at 260 miles an hour at 2,500 mile stage. In America, on the other hand, 80 of tin; largest and fastest transport planes yet built arc being constructed for Pan-American Airways and domestic companies, and these will cruise at 285 miles an hour for an extreme range of 5,000 miles. They will be owr twice as large as the Empire flying boats. 'The construction of large ocean going flying' boats have also no/ been neglected in America. Engine repairs in the air are possible on these craft. 'There is a need for 'wider public understanding of the enormous poten tial power which lies In international and overseas airways as a post-war development,' Mr. Fysh continued, 'This is no time in which Allies and friends should attempt to take advan tage of one another's preoccupation, and the old friendly national rivalries must be' forgotten. Rather must we give our maximum attention t/o obtain ing victory and so provide the only foundation on which our international air operations of the future can be built. 'To obtain the maximum assistance' from Allied civil aviation in the war. a closely co-ordinated and directed effort is necessary. Pan American Airways, K.L.M. and K.N.I.L..M. are lending magnificent assistance to wards the war needs of Empire ail traffic.' ___________
