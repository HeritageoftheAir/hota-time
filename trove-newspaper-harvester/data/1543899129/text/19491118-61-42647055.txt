 TEST FLIGHT OF D.H. COMET &nbsp; &nbsp; LONDON-SYDNEY in 36 HOURS. &nbsp; &nbsp; LONDON. Nov.16 (A.A.P.)â€”A De Havilland four-jet Comet will fly from London to Sydney in 36 hours when it makes its test flight to Australia and New Zealand early next year. A De Havilland spokesman said to-day: "She will not be hurrying. She will probably land at Cairo, New Delhi, Singapore, Darwin, Sydney and Auckland. She will cruise at about 500 m.p.h. and spend about 90 minutes on the ground refuelling." The spokes- man said that the Comets would start on the regular Australian run about 1953.
