 JET FLIGHT PLANNED IPCID London To Sydney In 36 Hours LONDON, Nov. 16: The De Havilland four-jet Comet will fly from London to Sydney in 36 hours when it makes its test flight to Australia and New Zealand early next year, a De Havilland spokesman said to day. "She will not be hurrying," the spokesman said. "She will prob ably land at Cairo, New Delhi, Singapore, Darwin, Sydney and Auckland. She will cruise at about 500 m.p.h. and spend about 90 minutes on the ground refuelling. "She may break one or two records, but so far as we are concerned that will be purely incidental. The aim of the flight is to see how she likes the trip. Comets will start on the regular Australian run about 1953, but we want to see how they behave on the route first. "We are very pleased with the Comet's recent fli ht to Africa and back. There is no truth in reports that fuel consumption was disappointing. She is all that we hoped she would be." -A.A.P.
