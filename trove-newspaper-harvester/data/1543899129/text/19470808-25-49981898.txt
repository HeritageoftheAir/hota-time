 LONDON-SYDNEY IN 24 HOURS The British Minister for Civil Aviation (Lord Nathan), who arrived in Darwin on Tuesday night, said in an in- terview that within a reason- able period the flying time be- tween London and Sydney would be reduced to 40 hours, and it was reasonable to as- sume at the rate of present progress, that wthin thÂ« life- time of middle-aged men, big airliners would be making the trip in 24 hours. ! Lord Nathan ls here at the ! invitation of the Common- wealth Government for talks on matters affecting civil avia- tion. He is accompanied by Lady Nathan, who is chairman of the London County Council -the second woman to hold the post. Lord Nathan said that devel- opments in civil aviation were becoming very rapid, but it had not yet passed from the stage of being an art to the stage of being an exact science. Aircraft design, for instance, was still largely a matter of hit or miss, but the number of misses was gradually being re- duced and the number of hits becoming more regular. Lord Nathan would not comment on new types of planes which may be seen in Darwin on the England-Aus- tralia run, but it is believed his reference to a 24-hour trip must concern the mighty Bra bazons which are still in the planning stage in England.
