 LONDON TO SYDNEY IN UNDER 40 HOURS ©Plans For Comet- Jet Airliner LONDON, March 22. — The v/orld s first passenger four jef airliner, the De Havilland Comet, won another record for British civil aviation yesterday when it flew 600 miles from London to Copenhagen —the same distance as from Canberra to Brisbane — in one hour, 18 minutes, 36 seconds. This astonishing airliner - will be operating commerci ally on the B.O.A.C. route to Australia in 1951 or early in 1952, on an express service from London to Sydney in something under 40 hours, in cluding four hours for stops en route. A correspondent who made the Copenhagen record flight in the Comet found that even when fly ing at 35,000 feet — about six miles up — at a speed of more than 550 miles an hour there was a queer, unbelievable quality about this air liner's rocklike steadiness and an absence of normal indications of air speed. 14 ORDERED Fourteen Comets, each costing £500,000 sterling, have been or dered from De Havilland by B.O.A.C. for the Kangaroo route from London to Sydney. The Comet seats 36 passengers, has separate compartments for bullion and diplomatic mall, men's and women's dressing rooms, wardrobes and galley. Even at the operational height of 40,000 feet the pressurised cabins make It possible for pas sengers to travel In the same com fort as they would at 8000 feet. Some Idea of the terrific speed Is got from the fact that she be gins to lose height at 150 miles distance from the destination air port.
