 LONDON TO SYDNEY. Six Days' Air Service. SCHEME BEING DISCUSSED. [AUSTRALIAN CABLE SERVICE.] LONDON, Monday.â€”"A scheme for a London-Sydney air mail in six days is being discussed," says the aeronautical writer of the "Evening News." The Idea involves the use of relays of machines, each flying 2000 miles nonstop, the last stage to the Australian coast being done in a seaplane. The use of the Fairey long-range monoplane is suggested, but this would be most expensive, and it is considered that a Puss Moth will serve, at least at the start.
