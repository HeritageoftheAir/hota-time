 CLOUSTON'S FLIGHT -A BEHIND SCOTT'S TIME IN SYDNEY TO-DAY "The Argus" Independent Cable Service LONDON, Thursday. Before he left Allahabad to- day for Singapore, Flying Officer A. E. Clouston was not hopeful of lowering the record from England to Darwin. He expects to reach Sydney to-morrow. Clouston is flying to Australia with Mr. V. A. Ricketts, air corre- spondent of the "Daily Express," and their original aim was to fly from London to New Zealand and back in 10 days. However, they have abandoned this objective, and will now try to establish a record for a flight from London to Sydney and return. "It seems obvious that we cannot beat Scott's time from England to Darwin," said Clouston. "There is no official record for this flight. The official record that we want-and can get, barring accidents-is from London to Sydney and return." Delay at Basra The record established by Mr. C. W. A. Scott and the late Mr. T. Campbell Black in the Centenary Air Race was 2 days 23 hours l8 seconds. Clouston said that his average speed had been 218 miles an hour and that he had maintained an altitude of 7,000ft. At Basra, where he was an hour behind Scott's time, engine trouble caused a delay of an hour. He took on an extra 50 gallons of petrol, and barely cleared the airport boun- dary. Stages of Flight Clouston and Ricketts left Eng- land at 8.20 p.m. on Tuesday. Their first stop was at Cairo and their second at Basra, which they reached at 5 p.m. local time yesterday (mid- night, Melbourne time). They left Basra at 7.42 p.m. local time (2.42 a.m., Thursday, Mel- bourne time) for Allahabad, which they reached^t 8.21 local time (1.21 p.m. Melbourne time). They left Allahabad at 9.58 a.m. (2.58 p.m. Melbourne time) for Singapore. Clouston was reported to have passed over Calcutta on his way to Singapore at 2.30 p.m. local time (6.30 p.m. Melbourne time). (Ricketts's Story-Page 9.)
