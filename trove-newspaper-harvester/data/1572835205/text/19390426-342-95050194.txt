 SWIFT TRANSPORT London-Sydney in Three Days 'PLANES READY IN 1942? Melbourne. April 25. Sir Donald Banks permanent Under-Secretary for Air in Great Britain, and one of three members of the British Air Mission to Aus tralia, said to-day that aeroplanes which would be able to cover tbe distance between London and Syd ney in three, days were now being built in England. They were land 'planes capable of a speed of 250 miles per hour for a range of 2000 miles. On. such a service, Sir Donald Banks said, tihe 'planes would ha#6 to fly day and night and make only six calls during the trip for re* six calls during tihetrip for re fuelling. They would be big enough to accommodate 12 passengers ^nd mail. It was not intended that this ser vice should supersede the existing flying boat service, which was both comfortable and popular. The new service would be used and recog nised entirely as a special express for passengers and mail. Because of lack of 'planes it would not be possible when the service was inaugurated to maintain a regular, service to a strict schedule. The type of 'plane to be used would have its first tests over tihe Atlantic ^ from Croydon (England), to America in about a year. . It is suggested that the 'planes will # be ready for the Australia service in 1942.
