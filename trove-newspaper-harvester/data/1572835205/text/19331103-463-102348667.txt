 LONDON TO SYDNEY IN THREE DAYS , 'With aeroplane engines in their present state of development it is possible for the flight from London to Sydney to be made within three days allowing for night flying and relief pilots,' said Flight-Lieutenant S. J. Moir, president of the ' NtÂ»w Smith Wnlps Aern dull. when re cently discussing the record that might be established in air races between London and Australia in the near future. .'The aerial distance between Lon don and Sydney is about 12,000 miles, according to flight reckoning,' added FHght-Lieutenarit Moir. 'There are already several reliable makes of aeroplanes which are consistently cruising at 260 miles an hour and are capable of up to 280 or 290 miles an hour, under favourable wind conditions. A pilot flying solo could make Sydney from London in one of these machines flying only ten hours per day, giving fourteen hours out of eath 24 ? for attention to the engine and rest and sleep. Assum ing the weather conditions were not favourable, and that head, instead cf following, winds, were encountered, then flying IS hours daily at 250 miles an hour ' would give a daily journey of 3000 miles, thus bringing Sydney within four days of London. 'But assuming the same machine was flown with relief pilots, with' emple provision for fuelling on the journey, it would be possible for 22 hours daily to be flown, which would give* a ' daily distance of from 5500 ' to 6000 miles, according to the wea ther and wind conditions. With fa vourable conditions and ordinary pilot's 'luck,' the journey to Syd ney could be' accomplished within from 48 to, SO hours from London.' Referring to the time likely to be taken by the winner of tbe centen ary air race from England to Aus tralia, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air-Commodore S. J. Goblo, said: 'I think two. and a half days to three days will win the race.' Sir Charles Eingsford Smith said that he thought the route could be covered in three find a half - days^.
