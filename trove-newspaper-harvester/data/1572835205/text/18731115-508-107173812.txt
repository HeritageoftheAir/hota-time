The Dutch States-General hare -voted the sums required for the Indian Budget. The permanent committee appointed to con sider the proposition for the prolon gation of President MacMahon's powers voted eight to seven in favour of the proposi tion, on the condition that those powers should date from the voting of constitutional laws. The minority refused to make any con cession. Reinforcements are being despatched to aid the military expedition of Colonel Wolseley in proceeding to besiege the capital of Ashantee. Tbe Spaniards having captured an American filibustering vessel — the Virginius — summarily tried and executed General Rayaw and forty eight of the crew. The feeling of indignation excited in America resulted in the adoption of a vigorous policy. An order by telegraph for stopping the execution was accidentally delayed. The death of Baron Lyveden is reported.
