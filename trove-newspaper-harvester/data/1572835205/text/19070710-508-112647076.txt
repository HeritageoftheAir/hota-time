 TO-DAT'S COMMERCIAL WHEAT A SHADE WEAKER. IN SYDNEY AND LONDON. The quiet tone at Mark Lan© is reflected in Sydney. A shipment of Victorian wheat has re-sold off English coast at a drop of l%d per quarter, as comoared with a sale of the same cargo a few days previously. This is a tri vial decline in itselt, but indicates that once again the reason assigned for the inflation of values in the Chicago 'pit' has not gained full credence in London. Another weakening factor at this side is Hie practical cessation of the export season from Australia to London, so far as regards cargoes. A few small lots of steamer parcels have yet io be sent away, but otherwise the export sea son is dormant until next Christmas, and this explains why Melbourne and Adelaide are both weaker. Some of the principal Sydney buyers have re duced their buying limits to the country equiva lent of 3s ll%d per bushel (Sydney), and some holders who a few days ago asked 4s 2d can not now get 4s. Several metropolitan and country r-illers have withdrawn from the wheat market because of the very little business doing in flour, and prefer to work-down the. stocks of grain without Trying more until the trend of London values becomes more denned. BACON AND EGGS SCARCE. Several agents and grocers ordered bacon freely late on Tuesday afternoon, anticipating a rise in values. Supplies are small, and re tailers report a better demand across counter. A brisk sale prevailed this morning for Nor thern River eggs, mostly at Is 7d a dozen wholesale. Sydney- suburban and South Coast were also in reauest at high prices.
