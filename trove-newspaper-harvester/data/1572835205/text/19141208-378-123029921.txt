 The Prowling Emden. HOW SHE GLEANED INFORMA TION. IllER UNLUCkY DA'Y WHEN SYD, NEY APPEARED. London, December 7. IReutcr's Mexandria correspondent states that an officer of the German cruiser limdcn told a passenger of a transport that the Emden had been cut off from communica tion for several weeks from the Ger man Government, but she calculated the position. of ships by intercepting wireless messages, or gleaned informa tion from newspapers found on prize ships. She might have captured seve ral mail-boats, but, as women and chidren wire aboard she decided to spare passenger ships. When coaling at Keeling Island they believed that the Australian transports were at least two da5's distantl. The Emden's officers complimented the Australian authorities on keeping the movements of the transports so secret. If the Enmden had known, that the Australian transports were so close, she w-ould have got amongst them, despite the Imowledge that she was going to cer lain destruction. It was bad luck that the Sydney happened to be so close, as the Emdcn had so far suc cessfully dodged vessels specially sent to intercept her.
