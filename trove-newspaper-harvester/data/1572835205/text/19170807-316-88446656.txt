 POPULAR AIRSHIP TRAVEL. LONDON TO .SYDNEY .IN FIVE DAYS. At a recent meeting in the Central Hall, Westminster, Mr G. Holt-Thom as delivered a lecture on commercial aeronautics. He said that in his op inion iteronautics would revolutionise the world not only from a commercial point of view, but from a humanitarian point, much more than it had revolu tionised warfare. He was not one of those who thought that commercial aeronautics were going to beat out of existence railways and other forms of transport, but rather that flying would act as an adjunct to the present modes of transport. Aviation having suffer ed in the past from mere discourage ment, the people of this country must see to it that in the future-it was fully encouraged. 'rom the business point of view speed was everything. A spe cial aeroplane, in the sense of a spe cial train, would enable a business mat to leave London in the moining, do his business in Paris, and be home again to dinner. It would take him to Baghdad in a day and a half, or to New York in two days. Ceylon would become 2% days from London; Tokio 41 days; Sydney live days; Cape Town three and a half days; Vancou ver three days. Many business men would smile at the idea of using this mode of conveyance, but the only thing was -to- remind -them. that they also smiled in the early days of motor cars, and yet half the business to-day would take double the time to do if the motor car was not in existence. As for the question of cost, it would be possible to run a prolitable air service between London and Paris at k£5 per passenger, ½d per ounce for mails, and 2/ each for parcels of 31b. Con stantinople or Moscow, a journey of 24 hours, might involve a cost of £25 per ticket.
