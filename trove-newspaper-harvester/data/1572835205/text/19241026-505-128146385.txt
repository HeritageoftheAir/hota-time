 SYDNEY TO LONDON IN TEN DAYS. This photograph is of the newest Am erican air-liner, the Z.R.3, recently com pleted in Germany for the United States ! Navy. It will be used as a passenger liner, and has luxuriously-fitted cabins. A tact which makes it particularly in teresting to Australia is that it is similar in all respects, with the exception ,of size, to the ships that will be used in connection with the England-Australia airship service at present being investi gated and organised by Sir Keith Smith, K.B.E. These Australian ships will be twice the size of the American giant. They will have a speed of between 70 and 75 miles an hour, and carry up to 120 passengers. They will be equipped, says Sir Keith Smith, with bathrooms, sleeping and dining accommodation, small, closcd-in promenade space and lounge. They will have all the facili ties of an ocean liner. The starting point for the service, which, it is anti cipated, will be commenced in two years, will bo Sydney or Melbourne, perhaps Canberra. The first stop will be Port Darwin, then Singapore, Calcutta, Ka rachi, Bagdad, Cairo and London By means of wireless the navigators will be able to co-operate with meteorological stations and thus avoid: storms and bad weather by working around them. This will be accomplished without any loss of time. Air-sickness will be nonexis tent. Even on a 'bumpy' day, air pockcts have'no effect on a ship so large and long. .
