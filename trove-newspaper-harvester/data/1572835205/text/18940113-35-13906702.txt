Dodo does not quite justify its eleven editions Dodo is the daughter of commenplaco people, the Vanes, and she is loved by two mea, Jack Broxton and his cousin Lord Chesterton! She elects to marry the latter, who is a good stupid fellow She tires of lum desperately and soon, and Jack comes baok from a tour abroad, and his society relieves her ennui Her baby is born, which she neglects, and aho is riding with Jack in the park when the death of the child from convul | nona is announoed to her Although friends, Mrs Vivian and others, endeavour to break off the intimacy with Broxton, it continues, without suapioion fron Chesterfard But an interview between Dodo uad Broxton, when she challenges | htm to elope with her and he refuses because he canaot be " snoh a blackguard," is witnessed partly by Dodo's sister Ma«d, who goes down- stairs horrified and tells her husband Thui revelation Chestcrford overhears He I is an impossibly good person, this miserable husband, and ho is so scrupulous as to act towards Dodo ontirely as if he knew nothing So I much perfection cannot last, and that roost useful duel ex machina, a spill while hunting, removes him after Dodo has made a deathbed scene of penitence Broxton now becomes Lord Chesterfoid, and after a decent interval his engagement With Dodo is announced But a certain austrian noble, Prince Waldenech whom the first Lord Chesterford had forbiddon his wifo to reçoive because ho was " an awful brute," comes upon the scene, and at the eleventh hour Dodo, fickle to the last, accept« bim, and the book closes with Broxton calling at her houso to learn that " her Serene Hi ghees has left for Paris " There is nething much in the book besides this woman Certainly Mr Benson crowds his stage with automata, most .f thom very jerky But Dodo is overrthing The book pretends to be little but a promenade for her, and almost from the first to the final page wo haye thiB last analysis of the smartest of the smart set to day She must be a bowildering und awful phenomenon to the people who have been receiving with rapture the painfully serious and self-conscious women of tho othor school Dodo 19 human, and she com- municates life, this frank, audacious, selfish, and inconsistant woman She has no moro eant than a child, and no more self-control She marnes Chesterford bocauso ho is very rioh, and she " wants to know what love is " Sho finds maternity a bore She quarrels with her husband about "Waldeneoh, and makes it up at onco -not by giving ra, for she carnes her point, out m arder not to bother herself And at tho verv lost when sho has pro- mised tn marry Broxton, sho quarrels with him about Waldenech, and marries that mysterious Austrian at last AH the time she talks and talks Nothing is sacred, her keen eyes see every- thing, and her keen tongue roveals If Dodo's is the speech of "smartness" of the ond ot the century, it is indeed necessary for society to scatter to the four winds at frequent intervals in order to recupsrate Dialogue there is hardly any in Mr Benson's work-it is a feminine monologue of a fluency inconceivable when he dues devote himself to conversations s deux, the author Btnves after opigram which is perilous even for people who have no reserve Mr Benson himself is rather prsvokang in pi opna persord He is capable of a good deal m the way of platitudo, and his wit when he so far con- descends, is e-rrogrons But nheu tho garrulity and the laboured wit and the attitudes are all token into account, there still remains a striking picture of an individual woman and a state of socioty a " detail " if "Mr Benson likes the term, but really strong Tho test is that one reads Dodo, and ends with a sympathy for her The roader feels that here is a woman, and not a pieco of furniture, hut not a woman of tho Idéala type In contrast to that I tho whole tendency of tho book might bo quoted , Sonous-mmdod peopio will call it flropant, the dull may consider it improuer, but allowing for all its faults it is a notable book from a 'prentico hand, and as Mr Benson matures it is possible that he may do some- thing towards rehabilitating the English novel His subordinate peopio are in a few cases dis- tinctly-Mrs Vivian, Maud, Edith Staines, Lady Grantham, hut after all tho only person that counts u Dodo_
