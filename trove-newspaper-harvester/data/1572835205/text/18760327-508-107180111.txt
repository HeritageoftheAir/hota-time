The Queen's Ifew Title BUI, after a long animated debate, was read a third time in the House of Commons by a majority, on division, of 289 to 114. Mr. Disraeli said all political reasoning was in favour of the Bill, and he pointed out specially, that as the advance ot Bussia towards the Indian frontier for the conquest of Tartary was well known throughout India, the assumption by the Queen of the title of Empress of India, would be regarded as an unmistakable sign of a resolution on the part of England to maintain her Indian Empire. . Mr. Lowe and Mr. Faucet* strongly censured Mr. Disraeli's allusion to the design of 'Russia as incautious and unwise.
