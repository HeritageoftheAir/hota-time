 THE LONDON BOARD. : ' SYDNEY, Suxday; With reference to the cablo message an nouncing" the: retirement of two of the Lon don direotors of the Australian Joint Stock Bank, this has been caivicd out in pursuance of tile strict policy of economy inaugurated since the'reconstruction of the bank. Corro; spondcnce has for some timo been passing with the London board with the view of ascertaining if somo reduction in the ex penses of the olfico there could not be effected. It was thought, in view of t.ho more restricted nature of tho bank's business, in London,- that instead of maintaining a board of Ave direotors throe would be ample to transact all business of tho bank in Great Britain. Special efforts wero made to retain the services of Mr. Mort, who has had a very long connection with tho institution. although for some lima past ho has urged his claim to be relieved from the responsi bility of fulfilling llie functions of a director. It was suggested from the head office in Sydney that tho board should be reduced from five members to three, and that a ballot be bold to decide wlio should retire. It is not known whetlior this was done, but it is assumed that Mr. Mort has pressed his claim to retire, and Mr. Gardiner lias arranged, to leave the board simultaneously with liim. Tho i eduction in tho number of the board is purely 11.1 aot of ouuuomy, nti I not the result of any .division among tho board upon any question whatever.
