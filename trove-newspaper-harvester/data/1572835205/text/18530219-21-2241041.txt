Gold Dust continues at £3 16s. 3d. and upwards for good samples. The sudden rapid rise at Melbourne, and its subsequent fluctuations, at such extreme rates, has perplexed purchasers here, but parties coming over may still fairly calculate upon obtaining an advance on the Melbourne price.—Fingal Gold Dust is now being obtained in marketable quantities, and may be quoted at £3 12s. What is at present obtained is evidently not equal in fineness to Victoria &nbsp; Gold ; but until an assay, which is about to be made, is effected, it is not practicable to affix its relative value, which appears at present to be about the same &nbsp; as Sydney Gold. A sample of one ounce of Fingal Gold, procured within two feet of the surface, is now &nbsp; at my office, and may be seen by any one. Exchange on London, drafts against Gold 2 per ?cent, discount on 65s. advance. The banks issue their drafts at 1 per cent, piemium. Ti eight to London by «ailing vessels 4?d. per ounce.
