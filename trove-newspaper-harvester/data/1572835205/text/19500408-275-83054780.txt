 Sydney - London Airliner Picks Up Lost Day LONDON, Sat (AAP): A BOAC Constellation reached London last night almost on time despite having left Sydney 24 hours late. The pilot cut short overnight stops to catch up the lost day. The total journey took three days, four hours, 15 minutes, which is a record for any regular service on the Australia London route. No service had previously succeeded in making up so much lost time in either direction.
