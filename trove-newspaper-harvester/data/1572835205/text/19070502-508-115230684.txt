' ? . Shippers here do not care to risk the' charterT ing of sailers, as wheat is very difficult to 4-h- tain, and there is no ?' pibesent'' cnattce ' of 'trick ing up 20,000 to 30;O00 bags a week' at a payable average for the London market Further busi ness may be done with Liverpool, and Japaa by I steamer. Nearly all the wheat, now on Darling Island will probably be shipped within ' a teyr I weeks for Queensland, Noumea, the TTnited I KiDgdom, Japan, and South America. I -FLOUR WELL HELD.' : ; I The recent offers of 'New. South -Wales country [ makes of flour at cheap rates to Sydney have I been withdrawn, and these brands - are ? now I nearer on a line with Sydnej- roller. -Reports from Riverina and several other -districts vin I New South Wales, as well as from, parts, of I Victoria and South Australia, confirm the news about parched wheat areas, «ie impossibility of ploughing: there until rain comes, and the likelihood of a shrinkage in this season's total sowings of earlv and late wheats. SPURT IN MAIZE AKD OATS. ' The beginning of ? a month has /brought a large number of orders for maize, and. prices for northern-river yellow (both the; yellow, and ihe white) have advanced, in sympathy ...with the rise in .chaff, lucerne, . bran, ? and: pollard. Several holders : who', let prime; yellows go at 2s S^id would have stood out for 2s lodif it had not been that an- extra large lot was -expected from the Clarence for Friday's market. Algerian oats 'rose a' penny a Wushel all round — for feed, milling, and. seed,'- in eym-? - pathy with the- general advance in '~ kindred lines. '' ?.???' ' ' '? - ' ' BUTTER -DEARER. - The cold temperatures and' harsh' winds -have further reduced the. output, of New - South ! 'Wales butter, and another rise of ' 2s a cwt tras made.

The Sydney yardirigs of pigs in Sydney ':at pre fodi are 60 to. 70 per cent. of baconers at extra pood quality, and the tendency is downward for this class. ' . ' . !, Porkers are -exceedingly scarce and Siear for the time, of year, and full rates are paid. It ' hitherto was the custom for years for; many thousands of store pigs to he forwarded -every autumn and winter from the back country, bat the fre .aying of rabbit. poison' has discouraged :he pig breeders in the back, country, and 80. per i-ent. of them have turned to something else. These stores used to be sent from far in 'and to Sydney, and to fatteners on the North and South Coasts.
