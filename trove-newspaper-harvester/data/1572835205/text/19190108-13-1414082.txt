 SYDNEY TO LONDON IN 4 DAYS j Prospects of Air Travel: . The managing director of a London air- craft manufacturing company says that he] is absolutely confident that within a reason- able lime aeroplane trips between Mel- bourne and Jvonelon at a net speed of 100 miles an hour will bo a regular institution. The journey between. London and Sydney will occupy four days. Across America. Four army aeroplanes from San Diego (California) have arrived in New York, having completed the first transcontinental flight. Repeated breakdowns occurred, and the journey occupied a' month. 1 "Within five years navigation in an aero- plane in bael weather ought to be as easy as steering a ship in similar circumstances," declared the president of the Air Counçii - (Lord Weir) in a speech at Manchester à fortnight ago. "Already WP have aero- planes which are able to climb 10,000ft., travel 100 miles an hour, make a non-stop journey of 1,200 miles, alight on the sea. and rise again with a full load. A new and tre- mendous industry is about to be creyiteei out ! of the Koval Air Force, which has been trained an.il developed in war, and will put L its leesons into practice for the purposes til (?pence and civilisation. The Air Force, which had 285 oflicerB and 1,853 men in August, 1914, now includes 30,000 officers and . 260,000 men, besides 3O,'00O women and boys. j The chief problems of the immediate future are severe iiavigational-itraininic,'- the »crea- tion of an energetic meteorological service, the adoption of improved wireless tele- graphy and telephony, and the adoption of a iirst-claBs sj-stem of day and night innrk | ing of landing places and aerodromes. These things will cost a lot of money, but they 1 will consummate and justify the work of the men who have died." j Since this statement by Lord Weir a Handiej'-Page aeroplane, carrying an Aus- tralian officer as passenger, has ilovvn from . London to Calcutta.
