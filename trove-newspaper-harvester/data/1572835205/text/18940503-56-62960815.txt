There were exciting scenes in Washing ton in connection with the Labor Day demonstrations of the Coxeyites. A contingent of tbe ' army ' numbering 400 and headed by a band, and carrying banners bearing blasphemous inscriptions, marched to the ground surrounding the Capitol. Coxey and his wife and daughter headed the procession. The daughter was iresssd in fantastic attire, and was supposed to represent the Goddess of Peace. She rode on a white horse. Coxey and Carl Brown, another of the labor army's leaders, jumped the wall, but were pursued and captured before they could ascend the steps of the- Capitol or speak. Both men were hustled out of the grounds, and the mob' becoming riotous in consequence, the' police used their batons freely and dispersed the ' army.' The movement has ended in a complete fiasco. A mob of 7000 unemployed committed a number of excesses in Cleveland, state bf Ohio. Several persons were injured. '
