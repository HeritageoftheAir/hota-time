 XONDON TO SYDNEY IH FIVE i DAYS. Possibilities of Airship* Travel. At a recent meeting in "London, iii. G. Holt-Thomas delivered-a lecture on commercial aeronautics. He said I ? humanitarian point, nmeajnoee than it had revolutionised warfare. Tie was not one of- those who thought that commercial aeronautics were going to beat out of existence .railways and other forms of transport, but rather than flying would act as an.adjunct to the present modes ."of" transport. Aviation Iraving suffered in the past from mere discouragement, the- peo- ple of th.s country must see to it that m the future it was fully, encouraged. From _^the business point of. view speed was everything. A special aero- plane, in the sense of a special train, would enable a business man to leave London in the morning, do his busi- ness in Paris, ind be home again to dinner. It would*_take him to Bagdad i m. a day and a half, or to New York in two days. Ceylon would become zî, days from'London;,Tokio 4i days; Sydney, five days; Capetown, si days; Vancouver, -3 i'.ays. Many businrss men »rm'á smîL-.at the idea 01 usi.ig this mode cf conveyance but tiie on- ly thing was to remind them that they, also smiled in the early days of motor cars, and yet half the business to-day would take" double the" time to do it if the motor-car. was not in ex- istence. As for the question of cost, it would be possible to run a profitable air service between -London and Paris at £5 per passenger, id- per oz. for mails, and 2/ each for parcels of 3lbs. Constantinople or Moscow^ a ionrncy of 24 honra, might" involve a coat of i^per'ticket^ - - " -
