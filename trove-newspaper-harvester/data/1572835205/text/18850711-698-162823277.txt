 London to Sydney in 28 days. Some time ago (says the Auckland Evening Star) our London correspondent stated that ere long arrange mente would probably be perfected whereby ihe con veyance of mails between London and Auckland would be accomplished within from 28 to 30 days. The prospect seemed too alluring to be altogether real, but Mr. Boucicault (who was a passenger by the Zealandia yesterday) informs us that Mr. Pcarce, on behalf of Messrs. Elder and Company, has sent in to -the Government an offer to place the steamers Alaska and Arizona on the line between San Francisco and Auckland and Sydney, carrying out with them a forked service from Fiji. Both steamers are now in the trans-Atlantic trade, and are recognised ocean greyhounds. By means of them Mr. Pearce undertakes to do the service from London to Sydney in 28 days, and from London to Auckland in 27 days. Mr. Bouci cault VhJT*Vft that the Imperial Government should sub sidise this sendee, and in the letters which he has been engaged ia write for the London Times he intends to strongly advocate the justice and expediency of such a contribution.
